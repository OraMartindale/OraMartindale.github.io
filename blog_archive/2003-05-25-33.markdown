**Matrix w/ Links**
  
After marveling at the writing and inticasy of the first Matrix, I was shocked when I heard they were going to make 2 more. They had done everything they could do, intellectually speaking, in the first Matrix. How were they going to follow that up. Let me explain:
  

  
The first Matrix is in part an interesting philosophical story with strong Biblical overtones. 
  

  
Messiah: You have a messiah character, [Neo](http://www.allposters.com/GetPoster.asp?APNum=379120&f=c&fid=798&P=1&PP=6), who doubts he is really the messiah. His real name is Thomas Anderson, therefore he is a "Doubting Thomas." 
  

  
Spiritual and Physical Worlds: He discovers that there are two worlds, the one he knows and the one that is real. While I never thought of it this way when watching it, I heard the TV show Touched by an Angel relate these two worlds to our world and the spiritual world. I find it rather an accurate analogy. People from the true/spiritual world battle (for the most part) in the world we normally think of as real.
  

  
Miracles: "Agents" and people who have been freed from the Matrix can "bend the rules" of the Matrix. Essentially creating miracles.
  

  
Prophecy: Old woman makes prophecies. Some come true, some don't, sometimes she's lying.
  

  
Names: One character is named [Trinity](http://www.allposters.com/GetPoster.asp?APNum=379121&f=c&fid=798&P=2&PP=6) and the last city of free people is called Zion. The ship they travel within is called the Nebacanezzer.
  

  
Judas: One character betrays the team and turns Neo and the rest over to the Agents in exchange for having his memory erased and himself put back into the Matrix. An interesting 30 pieces of silver.
  

  
Death and Resurrection: Neo, the messiah character, dies and is resurrected because of the love of Trinity.
  

  
Accension: The final scene of the movie is one in which Neo learns to fly and thereby accends into the clouds.
  

  
While all this Biblical referencing is interesting it brings up a lot of problems in peoples Christian theology and may confuse many Christians and non-Christians as to who Jesus was and thought he was. Neo wanders around both movies wondering what he should be doing and doubting that he is the messiah. Jesus knew who he was, repeatedly told people he was the Messiah and the Son of God and knew that his end destination would be the cross. They also refer to Neo as a second coming of one who could reshape the Matrix as he saw fit. The problem with this analogy is that Jesus' second coming will be nothing like his first. While Neo does nothing new that he did not do in his first coming, Jesus' second coming will be as a conquering warrior to set up His eternal kingdom. Far different from His first coming to redeem His people.
  

  
Prophecies in the Bible are only there because the prophets were proven to be 100% accurate, 100% of the time. Any prophet who made a prophecy that didn't come true was not reliable and did not meet the qualifications set out in Deuteronomy to be included in the Bible. The "prophet" of the Matrix is an old woman who will lie to you because it's "what you needed to hear." This could hardly be considered accurate.
  

  
The idea that miracles are nothing more than someone being able to tap into another existence or realizing there is no spoon or simply bending or breaking the rules of the Matrix, deny the supernatural power that Jesus had to perform these miracles.
  

  
With those problems being understood, I was amazed at the depth the writer/director/brothers had put into their story telling. But now that they've addressed his coming, death, resurrection and accension, where is the second and third movie supposed to go? So I went to the second movie with low expectations and was not disappointed.
  

  
The action is amazing. The SFX are amazing but obviously fake in many spots. The story is very interesting. It even manages to expand a little in its philosophy. Free will is discussed at length as well as one's purpose. Neo can't understand how the phophet can know what he will do in the future and yet he can still decide what he will do. If she already knows, doesn't that mean he has know choice. While the movie addresses the question it gives only trite answers. Thoughout the movie, the discussion of ones purpose is discussed. Neo is still trying to find his purpose and the ridding of old programs (represented as people indistiguishable from those who are Coppertops for the machines) once their purpose is done. One character as he is dying talks of his purpose being completed and indeed it was. All these make it very interesting.
  

  
A actor I haven't seen in a while is [Harold Perrineau](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Perrineau%20Jr.,%20Harold). I don't get HBO so I don't get to see his series OZ. He plays [Link](http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html) and is the brother-in-law of Dozer and Tank from the first Matrix. I was wondering why Tank was in any previews and the movie covers that nicely.
  

  
However, I can't recommend this movie. While I have argued that the original Matrix is a [PG-13 movie](http://www.filmratings.com/) with a [rated R song during the credits](http://www.ratm.com/), the Reloading of the Matix is solidly rated R and then some. There is one very uncomfortable love scene between Neo and Trinity and while you don't see any [naughty bits](http://www.pythonline.com/) it's enough to make the movie R. Even worse it is intercut with scenes of crowds dancing extremely sexually. It gives the entire scene the feeling of an [orgy](http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=orgy). If each scene had been done separately I don't know that I would have noticed or felt so uncomfortable, but the editing of the two scenes together made it very obvious what the director/brothers were trying to show. Wait for [Clean Films](http://www.cleanfilms.com/) to get their hands on this one before seeing it.
