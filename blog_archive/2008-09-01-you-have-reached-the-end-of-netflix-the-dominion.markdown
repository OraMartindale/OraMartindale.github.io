My Netflix queue is empty! What to watch now? When we began using Netflix several years ago we first were catching up on lots of TV series where we may have seen a few episodes, but wanted to go back and catch them all: Monk, Lost, Numb3rs, etc. But now we are caught up on our favorite shows and there aren't very many movies that we're interested in, so I find myself trying to figure out what to fill my Netflix queue with.  
  
I gave up on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in about it's 2nd or 3rd season. Looking back I realized that is about the time I moved to college, so there was a lot of other things occupying my mind at the time which might be why I stopped watching. Recently I've wanted to go back and catch some of it, but I'm not interested in watching all 7 seasons on DVD, so I've been thinking about selectively watching only The Dominion episodes.   
  
This is a bit like doing what X-Files did with their "Mythology" sets: You can buy DVD sets of the various story arcs that run through the X-Files TV series. There are 4 different volumes: [Alien] Abduction, Black Oil, Colonization and Super Soldiers. I had stopped watching the series before episodes about colonization and super soldiers began.  
  
Star Trek has done something similar with their "Fan Collectives" so named because they let fans vote on the episodes that would make it into the DVDs. The collectives include "Borg," "Time Travel," "Q" and "Klingon." I can't fault their choice of subjects; however, the sets only contain the most popular (or highlights) of those subjects, not all episodes on the subject as the X-Files does. But I want to see The Dominion since their the episodes that I missed. But there is no fan collective for those.  
  
So how would I go about finding those episodes. Well, it turns out that the Star Trek website has a [Dominion War timeline](http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/documentaries/article/4062.html) that gives each episode, but it can be difficult to correlate the episode numbers with each season and DVD, so here's the breakdown:

The Jem'Hadar (Episode 26, DVD Disc 7)  
  
**Season 3**  
The Search, Part I & II (Episodes 1 & 2, DVD Disc 1)

The Adversary (Episode 26, DVD Disc 7)  
  
**Season 4**  
The Way of the Warrior, Parts I & II (Episodes 1 & 2, DVD Disc 1)  
Homefront (Episode 10, DVD Disc 3)  
Paradise Lost (Episode 11, DVD Disc 3)  
  
**Season 5**  
Apocalypse Rising (Episode 1, DVD Disc 1)  
In Purgatory's Shadow (Episode 14, DVD Disc 4)  
By Inferno's Light (Episode 15, DVD Disc 4)

The Siege of AR-558 (Episode 8, DVD Disc 2)

Extreme Measures (Episode 23, DVD Disc 6)
