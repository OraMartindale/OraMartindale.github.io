Same day the storms came back. This time with a fury. We hadn't had any bad weather earlier, just the sirens and tornado warning. But now it came with strong hail. In my life I don't think I have seen hail this big. Many peices were golf-ball sized. As they fell the entire yard "danced" with white movement.  
  
A few minutes later it was done. I went into the front yard and picked up two of the largest peices of hail and brought them in for Ora and Aspen to look at. Afte showing them, I was about to throw them back into the yard when Ora said "No."  
  
"Why not?"  
  
"We have to put them in the freezer."  
  
Now there are two peices of hail in my freezer. Thank you Gary Lezack.
