This is a very detailed biography of Walt Disney; the audio version was 33 hours long. The author's emphasis is that Walt wanted control so he could create perfection. When he couldn't have that he tired of it and went on to something else: He began with animated shorts and kept pushing to make them perfect: add sound, add color, make the animations more realistic. He then went on to make movies and left the shorts behind for other people to work on. During World War 2 he couldn't make movies because of the demand for shorts for propoganda and because Bank of America would not let them make expensive features while carrying so much debt with the bank. When he resumed making movies they did not live up to his perfect ideals, so he left them to other people and went on to something else: miniatures, trains and eventually Disneyland. With Disneyland a success he went on to begin work on Disney World. Epcot was intended to be a controlled and perfect city, but Disney died before it could be completed and his brother, Roy, reduced Walt's vision to a permanent international fair.
