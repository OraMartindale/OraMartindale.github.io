[![The Dark Side](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1245181934m/3280003.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3280003.The_Dark_Side) [The Dark Side](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3280003.The_Dark_Side) by [Jane Mayer](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/485392.Jane_Mayer)  
  


rating: 5 of 5 stars  
  
There are not a lot of books that I read that make me want to take some form of action. Jane Mayer does an excellent job of documenting the legal overstepping done by the Bush administration. She also does an excellent of documenting that although the Bush administration says that "enhanced" interrogation techniques have yielded actionable intelligence, in reality the intelligence that we have used has come from traditional interrogation techniques; torture only results in those being tortured saying anything in order to stop the torture.

  
  


But even if torture did provide us with actionable intelligence, does that justify it? America from its inception has denounced torture and led the world in human rights and creating international laws to stop torture. We as a country have lost our moral compass and justified it in the name of keeping ourselves safe. But we aren't safer. We have bad intelligence created by bad interrogations.

  
  


Obama's decision to end torture will allow traditional interrogation techniques to deliver better intelligence and make us safer.

  
  


I said that this book made me want to take action. I voted for Bush twice and I am a registered Republican. After reading this book, I considered very strongly no longer being a Republican. Ultimately I decided that being outside the party would not cause the party to reform. There are plenty of people outside the party that are saying these things and they are falling on deaf ears. Only Republicans working from inside the party will be able to convince the party to reform.
