Ora 5's birthday is coming up and he wants the Transformer Bumblbee. It's the only thing that he consistently asks for, but it is sold out almost everywhere. I find myself willing to pay 3 times the amount so that I can get it for him. Now I understand those Tickle Me Elmo parents from a decade ago.
