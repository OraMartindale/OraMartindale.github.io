**2-year old survives along for 3 weeks**
  
[This article](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/09/30/toddler.alone.ap/index.html) is really sick. While mom's in jail she told everyone her 2-year-old girl was with neighbors. She was actually alone in thier apartment for 3 weeks. I'm amazed at the resourcefulness of this little kid. I don't know that Ora could have done this.
