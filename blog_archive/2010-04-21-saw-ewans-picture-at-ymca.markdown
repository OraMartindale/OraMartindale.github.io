I was working out at the YMCA this morning and suddenly saw my son's picture on their TV screens. He had a very grumpy face with his lower lip stuck way out in a pouty expression. It was an ad telling people to fell better by going to Yoga classes. LOL

At first I didn't believe it was him, but I couldn't deny it: same hair, Ewan's shirt and I've seen that expression, too. I wondered if they had stolen a pic from Enid's Flickr page, but after checking there I found that she had no pictures of Ewan like that, so they must have taken it one time when he was unhappy that we had dropped him off at the Y kid care.
