We went and saw Pirates 3 tonight. Not as good as the first 2 with many squandered opportunities to make it great. I was confused by the part that happens after the credits. Elizabeth faithfully waits for Will to come ashore after 10 years separate, but she doesn't appear to be 10 years older. I thought this was a horrible job of continuity until Rick reminded me what Jack went in search of just before the credits.
