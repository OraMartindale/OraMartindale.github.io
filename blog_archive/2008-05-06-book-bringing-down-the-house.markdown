I liked the book, but it lacks much drama. It's interesting to see what they did and how they did it, but there's more action in the commercial for the movie than in this book.  
  
I found one point particularly interesting: They were able to pull off much of what they did because of the racial prejudices of the casinos. Mostly Asian of Latino, everyone overlooked them as possible card counters.
