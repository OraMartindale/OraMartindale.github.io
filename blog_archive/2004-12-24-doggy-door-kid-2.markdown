Ora 5 long ago found the doggy door and grandma and Papa's house. He would climb through whenever he wanted to go outside instead of asking for someone to open the door for him. 
  

  
He's almost reached the point where he is too big for hit; however, Aspen observed how the dogs were getting in and out and began to explore how to get out.
