Since Ora 5 has a Nintendo DS with wireless capabilities and I have an iPod touch and I often have the church's multimedia laptop at home, I thought I would check prices for wireless routers. I was looking around Craigslist for a wireless router and could not find any with enough features for a price I was happy with. So found a vendor on Amazon.com selling a great wireless router for rock bottom prices.  
  
Ironically a co-worker just came back from a security conference where it was demonstrated how easy it is to break into a secure wireless network. I knew this already but the demonstrations he described just reinforced that.
