One of the kids' favorite shows right now is Phineas & Ferb. Each episode follows a very silimar pattern in which two kids (Phineas & Ferb) do something completely unrealistic with their summer day: build roller coasters, create a circus, build a snow resort, have chariot races, build a beach, etc.  
  
Often when beginning their quest, someone will ask about their age:  
"Aren't you a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?"  
"Aren't you a little young to use titanium and a welder?"  
  
Phineas will usually answer "Yes. Yes I am."  
  
In one episode, they turned it around when the kids mean Evander Hollifield: Phineas asks "Aren't you a little old to be a heavyweight boxing champion?"  
  
Hollifield answers "Yes. Yes I am."  
  
All this is prelude to what happened today: The kids were playing in the driveway and Ora 5 began riding on Ewan's tricylce. Seeing this I asked "Aren't you a little big to be playing on that?"  
  
A smile slowly emerged on Ora's face and I realized that I was the setup man for his joke: "Yes. Yes I am."
