Interesting look at the different players in the Katrina disaster. Like many cities New Orleans had no realistic disaster plan and had never tested it, so when it came time to handle the disaster there were many missteps. My only complaint is that the author points out many of these missteps as if the leaders should have still been able to handle those situations without a plan. The author is very fair to also point out when people, including "Brownie" did things right.
