**Oh, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.**
  
Okay, I was thinking my son was so smart! He's answering questions now!
  

  
Dad: "Do you want a drink?"
  
5: "Um hmm."
  

  
"Do you want to eat?"
  
"Um hmm."
  

  
"Do you want to read a book?"
  
"Um hmm."
  

  
But then I found he isn't actually answering. He's responding to any question with "Um hmm."
  

  
"Do you think your daddy's an idiot?"
  
"Um hmm."
  

  
"Do you want to give daddy a swift kick in the head?"
  
"Um hmm."
