Aspen recently said "I want a Daddy Date." This is when I take 1 kid out and do something with them (museum, zoo, fishing, etc.).   
  
Enid chimed in, "I want a Daddy Date too." It's been a while since we had time to ourselves, so I arranged for a babysitter and we went to see Shakespeare in the Park. They were doing the Merry Wives of Windsor.  
  
It was a lot of fun, but afterward I wondered how much of what we see on stage was in the original play. So I looked up a copy of the script. Shakespeare included very little state direction; only telling actors when to enter and leave. So everything else is reinterpretted by the the director or actors. The expressions, actions, innuendo, pauses to change the meaning of a line are all added and not part of the original script. So the director has a lot of license to change the meaning of certain parts for a modern audience. I'm not sure if I feel that it's good or bad, just interesting.
