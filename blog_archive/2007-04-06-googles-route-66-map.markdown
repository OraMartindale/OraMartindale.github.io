Google announced it's My Maps feature today and one of their examples is a [Route 66 map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;t=k&om=1&msid=103763259662194171141.000001119b4b42bf062c2&msa=0). It's better than [my unfinished Route 66 Map](/maps/route66/), but it's nice to know that great minds think alike.  
  
My Maps is a great feature. It allows you to create a map without knowing all the code in the background. In less than an hour I was able to create a [new map of our 2005 vacation to the Great Smokey Mountains and Biltmore Estate](http://www.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&hl=en&layer=&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=6&msid=110458830198340812249.00000111c49c1433bce64&msa=0).
