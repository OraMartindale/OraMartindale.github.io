Enid was taking a nap, so I thought I would pop in a movie and sort laundry. We had borrowed _Rear Window_ from the Library, so I put that in.  
  
Ora didn't like my choice of movies, because it wasn't his choice, and thought he saw an opportunity when the credits began to play at the beginning of the movie:  
  
"Sorry, daddy. It's already over."
