We were in Salina visiting Enid's parents and her dad recommended that we head out toward Ellsworth, KS, and see the new windmills that are along I-70. Since we visited Enid's grandma first, we took the long way to get back to Salina and came in on the windmills from the north and then took I-70 back into Salina.   
  
We drove thru the middle of all the windmills. They are so big that you can see them for 20 or 30 miles; so while you may think that you'll reach them at any moment, it takes a lot longer to get to them than you think it will and you see them for a long time after you've passed them.  
  
I've always thought the south winds of Kansas would be great for wind farms.
