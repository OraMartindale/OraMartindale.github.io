I don't know if I've talked here about Freedom Accounts, but I had to tell my experience today. I took the car in for an oil change and a 30,000 mile tranmission flush. Because of the flush, I knew I'd be paying a lot more than usual. Then the mechanic called and said that the front brakes needed replaced. A year ago this would have been my panic moment. But I knew I had my automotive Freedom Account.  
  
Mary Hunt talks about Freedome Accounts in her book The Complete Cheapskate. A Freedom Account is an account you setup to save for those expenses that you know you will have. There's not getting around the fact that cars, appliances, things break down. You're going to have to pay for them, so might as well setup accounts to handle them proactively instead of reactively.  
  
The total car bill today was $350. I'm not worried. I know that I have the money in my Freedom Account that I started last year to cover those expenses. As I drove away from the dealer I felt very at peace and my mind contrasted that with how I would have reacted a year ago.
