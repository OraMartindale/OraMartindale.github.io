**Kansas City's river-front park**
  
Enid, 5, myself and Enid's parents went to the City Market a few weeks ago. We walked a couple blocks north of the Market to a new bridge that has been built to an overlook on the Missouri river. A stairwell leads down to about 20 feet above the water where the trains run by the river. Enid and I had been there once before, but this time there was a construction bulletin board with the usual workers rights and wage information but also a project description. While the first time we didn't know why this new construction was out here, the board informed us that they are connecting it to a river-front park down the road.
  

  
If you were to drive from downtown North on Highway 9 you would see a beautiful park to the east right along the river. (You can also see it from the Paseo bridge on the west.) This a river-front park that is rather difficult to find. The plans we saw said they would connect this park to the new structure we were at by extending the river-front park to the west. Patrons would then go up to the platform, south towards the River Market and then west to the 4th street viaduct where it will once again connect to the river. 
  

  
I remember at one time I had heard that they wanted to create 20 miles of parks along the river-front. I don't know if this is the first part of that plan or something different, but I was impressed. I took a lot of pictures. I'm hoping that once this project is done, I can go back and take more pictures for a before and after.
