While I was in New York, my father-in-law emailed me information about the oven. He believed the heating element had died. When that happens, the oven is smart enough to notice and turn off the gas, which explains why neither was working. So I went to the Sears parts website (it feels like this is becoming one of my most used sites) and ordered the part. $70! How does such a small part cost $70? I also wanted to get it as soon as possible, so I paid $35 for the fastest shipping. I justified it in my mind by telling myself that the longer the oven didn't work, the more my family would spend eating out.  
  
So the part arrived today. I removed the old heating element and replaced it. Turned on the oven and voila, it works!  
  
The old heating element looks like it is part of a sci-fi ray gun, so Ora 5 claimed it as his new toy.
