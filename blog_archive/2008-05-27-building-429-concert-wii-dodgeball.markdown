Calvary 88.5 had a free concert today so we went. The weather was raining in the morning, but cleared off. (There was a 1-hour rain delay.)  
  
It was fun and the kids really got into it. Although they kept asking to buy food (Chick-fil-A was there) and were upset when we didn't.  
  
After the concert we ran into C.A. and he invited us to his house for hamburgers and brats. We went and after the food, one of the guests brought out his Wii and the 4 guys played dodgeball. I got into it too much and instead of flicking my wrist to throw the ball as I was advised, I was throwing my whole arm until it was sore. I'm probably lucky I didn't end up being one of those people who throws the remote through C.A.'s beautiful flat-screen TV.
