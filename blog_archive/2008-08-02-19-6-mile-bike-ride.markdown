Today was our second milestone ride: 20 miles. Instead of driving to Longview Lake, we biked to it, around it and back. It was 2 hours and we had a moving average of 12 MPH.  
  
At one spot a snapping turtle was trying to cross a busy road. I stopped to move it off into the grass, but I was in for a surprise. I was thinking it would be like picking up a box turtle, but larger. I approached him from the back and picked him put by the back half of his body; however, he immediately took is back legs, grabbed my hands and pushed my hands off of him. I hadn't expected the clawed feet so I dropped him out of surprise. He fell on his back and I thought _Well, he's dead now_, but he pushed himself upright using his head. He then turned towards me and opened his mouth wide and snapped at me.  
  
"I don't think he wants to be messed with," Enid observed.  
  
"Ok," I replied.  
  
I walked around the turtle back to my mike and he did a full turn keeping his head facing me the entire time with his mouth ready to bite if tried again.  
  
We pushed on. There was also organized run around the lake that day, so we saw many runners as well as the usual bikers.  
  
Here's a picture of us after our ride:
