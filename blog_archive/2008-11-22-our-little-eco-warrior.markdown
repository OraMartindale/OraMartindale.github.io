Ora 5 and I were on our way to pick up my new iPod touch when he saw a power plant. "Dad, we need to shut down that plant."  
  
"But, Ora, if we shut down the plant, then we won't have electricity for our house." He thought about that momentarily.  
  
"Okay, then I'll make it run on water."  
  
"That's not a bad idea, but the rivers have been getting lower and lower so I'm not sure how long that will work."  
  
"Then I'll make it run on the sun."  
  
"That's a good idea, but they are still working on solar technology and it doesn't produce enough energy for us yet."  
  
"Then I'll make it burn wood instead of coal."  
  
"That's a good idea, but burning wood pollutes, too."  
  
I'm sure he'll come up with a new idea soon.
