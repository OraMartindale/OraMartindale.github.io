**Max Day 2**
  
Day 2 and I'm sick. What started out on Monday as a tickle in my throat and Tuesday as a sore throat is now the flu. I'm hoping I don't infect too many people.
  

  
After lunch I had a couple of classes that B.J. was also taking or that were a slight duplicate of my all-day Tuesday class. So I went back to the hotel and slept for a couple hours.
  

  
I'm back at MAX for my last class and hope I can get through it okay. Mind over matter, or flu.
