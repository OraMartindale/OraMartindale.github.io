We've been watching the Tour de France almost every night and cheering for the Garmin Chipotle team, so I guess it shouldn't surprise me that the kids have grown fascinated by the jerseys. Ora 5 pulled out his yellow shirt and declared it his yellow jersey. Apsen watches the race looking for the polka-dot jersey (best climber) which is her favorite.
