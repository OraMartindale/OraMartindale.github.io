We are now owners of a minivan. We went looking around today and bought a Dodge Caravan. I originally had visions of Stow and Go seating and a DVD system, but wallet reality collided with the fantasy. We're very happy with what we have and it does have a roof rack which is something we really wanted to put our car-top carrier onto or to hitch bikes onto.
