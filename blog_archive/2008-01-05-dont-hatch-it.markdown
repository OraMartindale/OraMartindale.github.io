After Bible study this morning I decided to make french toast and scrambled eggs for the family. Aspen asked if she could help and I told her she could. After getting out the supplies, I grabbed the first egg. Aspen reached for it, obviously afraid that I would crack it instead of letting her and declared: "Don't hatch it!"
