Enid called yesterday and I noticed she was using the speaker phone. She explained that she couldn't find the handset. This is nothing unusual in our family. Ora 5 loves to pretend he's talking on the phone and routinely it ends up where we least expect. Well, last night it was _really_ where we least expected.
  

  
We started by searching the "usual suspect" places. Failing there we used the handy intercom button which rings both the base station and the handheld. We didn't hear the handheld at all. From this we assumed that he had hid it within the couch, in the bed sheets or some other place that would muffle the sound. Searched in the those places and again found nothing. After searching most of the house Enid's thoughts turned to one of Ora's favorite off-limit places: the master bathroom. Opening the door she didn't see any phone. She looked to the toilet. Opening the lid, she discovered what she most feared to find. Sitting at the bottom of the water sat the phone.
