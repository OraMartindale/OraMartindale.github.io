Ora 5's Birthday party was today. We've had trouble convincing him that he was Ora 5 because he kept saying "I'm not five, I'm four." Today I asked him if he was Ora 5 now. He agreed he was and asked how to write the number five so that he could let everyone know.  
  
Now I'm thinking about my birthday. Hmm... What do I want?
