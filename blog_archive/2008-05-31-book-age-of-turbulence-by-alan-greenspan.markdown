This is 2 books in one. The first half is Mr. Greenspan's life as an economist. He uses it partially to tell his autobiography and to tell you how he came to believe the economic theories that he describes in the second half of the book. I learned that the idea of free markets has not been a popular theory in the US and many felt the government must conrol markets in order for them to run efficiently. We even went so far as to implement price locking in the 70s.  
  
The second half of the book is dedicated to economic theory, so if you don't like economics, don't read it, but I ate up every word.
