Ewan took his first step tonight. For quite a while, when we set him down on the floor, he will stand momentarily and then get down on all fours. Tonight he was playing with a musical toy. He stood up and I expected him to begin dancing to the music, but instead he took one, deliberate step.  
  
I was so surprised, I shot a look at Enid. By the look on her face, I could tell she was  surprised as well.  
  
Ewan smiled at us and then got down on all fours.
