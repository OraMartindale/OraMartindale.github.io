The math goal's of the Pre-Kindergarten curriculum that we are using is that Ora can count by himself to 20, count to 100 with help, and add to 10 by 1s (1+1=2, 2+1=3, etc.)  
  
Enid started working with Ora today and helped him add to 10 by 1s. Then Ora continued right on to 20 without her help. Then she helped him add by 2s (1+2=3, 2+2=4, etc.). They went to 10 and then he continued beyond that. It wasn't till they got to adding by 3s that Ora began to get stumped.
