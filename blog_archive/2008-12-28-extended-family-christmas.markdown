Every other year we spend Christmas with my Mom's side of the family. I had just bought a new camera and 2Gb cards for it, so I filled it up taking lots of pictures and playing with the video function. Here's some videos from it:  
  
Great-Grandpa and Ora playing with electronics:  
  
  
Aspen, Eden and Ansley playing:
