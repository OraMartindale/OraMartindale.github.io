The summer after my senior year of high school I went on the GOBA bike ride with my grandparents. One of the events during the bike ride was a professional bicycling race. The race was a simple lap around one or two city blocks. I was amazed as I stood on the corner and watch dozens of racers speed by within inches of me (probably not the smartest place to stand in retrospect.  
  
So I was very excited when the Tour of Missouri was announced and that the first stage would be in Kansas City. I took the day off and we all went to see the race. It began and ended in the Country Club Plaza and ran about 2 hours. We went early and they had several streets blocked off with booths for many groups: Chipotle (a team sponsor) was giving away tortilla chips and you could enter for a chance to win a team jersey or a year of free food. Other booths were having drawings for jerseys and bikes. Ora 5 and Aspen won water bottles at one booth. Anheiser Busch (a big sponsor for the Tour of Missouri) had their clydesdale horses there and a car that looked like Shamu:

One person walked by and gave us some noise making bang sticks that they had one.   
  
After looking around here for a while we went to eat and staked out a place where we could watch the bikers come straight through the main boulevard of the Plaza, make a big turn and head up main street. A second person walked up and asked if we would like a second set of bang sticks, so now both Ora 5 and Aspen had one.

After they had gone by we went to Barnes and Noble bookstore and looked at books while we waited the couple of hours that it would take for the bikers to return. We then went and staked out our spot along Ward Parkway. The bikers would make three circuits along this road.  
  
Soon the race vehicles came by announcing that there were 5 in the lead pack. The pack came by and in less than a minute the rest of the 110 riders came wizzing by.

Ward Parkway is 6 lanes divided in the middle by a river or green spaces, so once the riders had gone by the crowd quickly crossed a bridge to the other side of Ward Parkway. A few minutes later the bikers returned on that side. By this time the main pack had already caught the lead rider. That amazed me. Then everyone rushed back to the first side. With 3 small children, we stayed on the first side until they had passed us 3 times and then went across the bridge to watch them come back the last time.  
  
When we got home that night I checked the results and 96 riders crossed the finish line in the same second! What a great start to the Tour of Missouri.
