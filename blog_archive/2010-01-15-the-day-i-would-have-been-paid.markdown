One of the interesting parts of my new job is that instead of getting paid twice a month, like at my old job, I will get paid once a month. Today would have been a pay day for me, but we are stretching our dollars to last to the end of the month. We've been planning for this since the last couple of weeks of December, so we're prepared, but I look forward to seeing that first check.  
  
I do like the idea of paying all my bills for the entire month on the first day of the month and then not worrying about them for the whole month.
