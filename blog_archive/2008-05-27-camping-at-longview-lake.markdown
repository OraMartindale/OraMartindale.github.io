We camped at Longview Lake over the Memorial Day weekend. It rained the first night and we almost aborted the camp trip. Instead we went home, watched the weather, decided to give it another night and bought a weather radio. We had great weather all Saturday and  that night as well. There was an 80% chance of rain Sunday night, so we cut our trip a day early.  
  
The only complaint that we had was that many of the other campers were rude or vulgar. I heard the F-word constantly from people of all age groups and had to warn one group of pre-teens that were playing in a greenspace next to our tent to watch their language! I don't run into that problem when camping at KOA. Do state campgrounds attract a different group of people than a KOA?  
  
On a lighter note, Ora 5 and Aspen met some friends on the playground. While there many kids were humming the Indiana Jones theme as they ran around the playground. It reminded me of myself and my brother playing on camp playgrounds and pretending to be in an Indiana Jones adventure.  
  
Here's some pics:
