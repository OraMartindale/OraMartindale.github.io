I just got back from Seattle on business. I took some time the first day in to see Pike's Place market:

buy a coffee from the original Starbuck's:

and go to the top of the Space Needle:

Washington is one of the states that I had never visited, so it became state #46. The only states that I have not been to yet are Alaska, Hawaii, Maine and Montana.
