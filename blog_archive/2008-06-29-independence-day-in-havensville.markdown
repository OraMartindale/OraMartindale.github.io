For years we have spent the weekend before Independence Day at my parents because my small home town celebrates big. This year there were a couple of new activities. Danny brought his motorcycle, so everyone got a ride:

And Ora 5 and Aspen found picking cherries to be a fascinating time:

They picked enough cherries that we made cherry ice cream and brought enough home to make cherry pie.
