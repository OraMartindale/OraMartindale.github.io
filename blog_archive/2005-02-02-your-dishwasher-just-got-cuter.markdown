We have a roll-away dishwasher that we hook up to the sink and run. This morning when I hooked it up, I forgot to turn on the water. This usually isn't a problem because we can just start the cycle at the beginning. Today, Aspen had left us a surprise: A stuffed animal had been placed on the heating element and caught on fire.  
  
Thankfully Enid smelled the smoke and turned the water on which promptly extinguished the fire. Unfortunately, the dishwasher was destroyed. I spent the morning cleaning up dishes and getting the smell out of the kitchen.  
  
That evening as we were driving home from shopping, my wife turned to look at me and said "Your dishwasher just got a lot cuter."  
  
Indeed.
