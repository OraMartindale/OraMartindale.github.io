[Jason](http://www.grizzlybase.com) sent me [this article about the NASA Shuttle program](http://www.idlewords.com/2005/08/a_rocket_to_nowhere.htm). It highlights the huge misappropriation of billions of dollars that the shuttle program is and how little science it has generated for us. The article contrasts that with NASA's unmanned exploration missions such as the [Odyssey and Spirit Mars Rovers](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html), [shooting asteroids](http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html), and this morning the [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html) launched. These have been highly successful and brought us tons of science!  
  
Now, I am a huge fan of manned space exploration and look forward to heading to space myself someday; however, it's obvious that NASA's strength is not manned exploration but rather unmanned. And for $100 million [Space Adventures will take you around the moon](http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,68495,00.html). That is 1/5th the cost it takes NASA just to shoot the Shuttle off the ground! For that same $100 million, [you could start an entire space tourism company](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/branson.html)! With Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos [getting into the game](http://www.blueorigin.com) and Las Vegas hotelier [Robert Bigelow](http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/) preparing to build an orbitting hotel, it's obvious that the private sector is eating NASA's lunch.
