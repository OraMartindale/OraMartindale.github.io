One hour before the show, I tried to buy tickets online for Meet the Robinsons in 3D.  
  
I was the link for the 8:30 show indicating it was not sold out, clicked the link, selected 2 adults and 2 children ($42!?!), and clicked Next. A message said that I could not purchase tickets for this show because it was sold out!  
  
I went back to the first page and, sure enough, the link was gone and time grayed out, indicating the show had sold out.  
  
I turned to my son, whom I had already told that we would see the movie that night, and gave him the bad news. He was so upset. He had been very good that evening on the promise that if he was good we could see the movie tonight.  
  
I promised him we would see the first show the next morning and promptly bought the tickets right then.
