**They're just words**
  
There's been an explosion of new words from Ora 5 recently, so here are some he says:
  

  
stars
  
moon
  
There's a dog.
  
Ah, man! (Mr. Stiles taught him that one in the church nursery)
  
mess
  
toast
  
night-night
  
All done.
  
Buzz (Lightyear)
  
mouse
  
baby
  
Bob (the Tomato)
  
up
  

  
Words he's close on:
  
rees = please
  
mo = Elmo or Nemo (depending on context)
  
aboo = Cebu
  

  
What has really impressed me is "stars." One night when walking out of the church, 5 pointed up and said "stars." But when we're looking at a book that his a sky with very definite five-point star shapes, he also says "star." And when playing with the shape sorter, he'll pick up the star shape and say star. So he is associating the shape that we call a star with the lights in the sky and the shapes in the book. It's pretty amazing.
