_This is part 3 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
The kids were up before 6am. Ora said we should get up.   
  
“The sun’s in the sky,” Ora explained.  
  
“Where did you expect it to be?” came dad’s tired and sarcastic answer.  
  
He then clapped twice and exclaimed: “Light’s on.” No lights came on.  
  
I looked at Enid. “Where did he learn that?”  
  
“I don’t know.”  
  
We made our preparations and left. Today would take us past Knoxville and then south into the Smokey Mountains. As we drove, the landscape, different from our own native Midwest, caught our attention. At one point Enid drew Ora ’s attention to some landscape: “Ora, look at the trees and big rocks.” I turned my head away from traffic to see as well. “Daddy, don’t,” came the command to the other Ora. Enid was thinking about how you would draw the trees we were seeing and drew the comparison between the shapes of trees. In the Midwest we see mostly “round trees;” here we were seeing “triangle trees.” Ivy covered the trees in many places. It created strange shapes like people encased underneath or Scooby-Doo ghosts.  
  
We stopped at a visitors center a few miles past Knoxville, TN. We found lots of hiking guides and camping books for the National Park. We bought National Park Passports and stamps for both the kids. This is something that I wish I had thought of when we went to Yellowstone 3 years ago. We could have stamped off the Badlands, Yellowstone and The Grand Tetons.  
  
If you’re not familiar with National Park Passports, they are small blue books that have all 400+ parks listed by region and some description of the features of each region. Then in each region there are places to put stamps and cancellations for eight parks. You purchase the stamps for each park (not all parks have a stamp) and then place the stamp into the passport. Then at the visitor center for the park you can stamp a cancellation onto the page. The cancellation has the park’s name, visitor center’s location and the date. We hope that when our kids leave our house they will have seen much of the countries historic and natural wonders and have 2-3 passports to show for it.

After leaving the visitor’s center, we left Interstate highways for the first time on our trip. We went south looking for a good picnic spot.  The next town was Pigeon Forge, home of Dolly Parton, and the county courthouse had a statue of Dolly.  As we ate lunch under the shade of a tree, I commented that it was hot day. Ora stated that it was a “sweaty” day.  
  
Pigeon Forge is a bad combination of Orlando, FL and Branson, MO. As we drove toward the National Park we could see the beautiful mountains growing in front of us; however, on both sides of us were stores filled with air brushed T-shirts, go-cart tracks, and no less than 4 bungee jumping towers. The peddlers around Disney World had found Dollywood. But then there were shows you could see including some that were the same as in Branson. All this was nestled in front of Smokey Mountain National Park’s entrance. It was the perfect storm of tourist traps.  
  
We entered the National Park and were so relieved when we left the touristy towns behind and were finally surrounded by forest. We stopped at the visitor center and took the kids inside to receive their Smokey Mountain NP stamps and get their cancellations in their passports.  
  
It was here that we began to notice many motorcycles, an occurrence that we would see a lot in this park. The visitor center even had a Harley Davidson on display to talk about the long history of motorcycles in the park.  
  
Then it was over the top. We took a 13-mile, curvy road up and over the Appalachian Mountains. We stopped at the top for pictures and walked a few feet of the Appalachian Trail. It was beautiful. My cousin had hiked the entire trail a few years back and I can see the attraction with so much beauty surrounding the mountains.  
  
Then it was down the other side and to our campground. We arrived at our campground in Bryson City and pitched our tent beside Deep Creek, a creek that finds its source near the gap we had just driven through.  It comes down all the way into Bryson City.   
  
Throughout our trip I had used directions from Yahoo! Maps. This time, Yahoo! Maps steered us wrong. Just before a bridge going over the river, it directed us onto a tiny road that was only a few feet from the river and only a foot above the water. The road was also dirt. You could tell that if the river ever flooded, the road would be completely submerged. We finally found our way to the camp, but knew that the road we were just on could not be the way that most people get there.  
  
The first thing we noticed was that it was buggy and muggy. There were gnats everywhere and the temperature and humidity were a lot higher than www.weather.com had led me to believe.  
  
On top of the bugs and the humidity, my camp setup didn’t go so well. For the most part everything went together okay, but the chance of rain had been threatening all day.   I needed to set something up to protect us. We had bought a canopy from Wal-Mart, but it didn’t go together very well. After several frustrating tries, I gave up and modified it into a lean-to. Even that wasn’t very successful - It leaned too much.   
  
I began to think about what a disaster this camp-out was going to be. We fixed dinner and then went to bed.
