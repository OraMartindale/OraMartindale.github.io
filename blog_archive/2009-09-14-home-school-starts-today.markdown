Enid begins homeschooling Ora 5 and Aspen today.  
  
Update: Enid reported that they had a good day of school. The kids were excited and very engaged. Aspen didn't show signs of having lost any of her reading skills over the summer. (We read to them so often that we sometimes forget that they should be reading to us!)  
  
We also began new reading books this evening. Enid read chapter 1 of the first Box Car Children book to Aspen and I read an Aesop fable to Ora 5 and a Newbury Honor book called Red Sails to Capri. It was a great first chapter to end a great first day of school.
