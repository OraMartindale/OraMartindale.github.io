We enjoyed the Mill Creek trail ride that we did with my uncle so much we decided we wanted to try it again, but this time, we'd attack it from the north. We began near the Kansas River and headed south. We passed Johnson Drive easily; this is where I had died on a trip earlier in the spring. Our goal was to go far enough south that we would reach the point that we had ended with my uncle; we didn't make it. One mile from our goal, the trail makes a sharp incline. I was not able to get up the first rise because I was pulling the trailer behind me. I walked/dragged the bike up the second rise and stopped. I then spent the next 5 minutes trying to not throw up. Enid, who had been ahead of us, came back to find me laying on the trail.  
  
When I had recovered, I pushed the bike and trailer up the next rise. It was more level here, so we got back on and pushed ahead. The trail continued an uphill climb, but while it was still challenging it was not steep. Then we reached a part that was steep once again. We were a half mile from where the hill had begun and I estimated that we were only a half mile from our goal, but we couldn't make it. We turned around and headed back.  
  
It was a tough ride and we got 9 miles in. We'll be back here next spring to challenge that hill once again.
