My brother was back from California for our home town's annual Independence Day parade and fireworks. Yes, it's early, but it always has been. We took him back to the airport and I decided to take the scenic route through Leavenworth, KS.  
  
When I was a kid one of my favorite parts about driving to Kansas City was going through Leavenworth, because there were herds of buffalo in the fields outside the Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. I wanted to go through the same area and show my kids the buffalo. As the large prison came into view I realized that the open fields had been replaced by buildings and houses and roads.  
  
"They're gone," I said. "If they put up all this stuff, where are the buffalo going to roam? There used to be buffalo that roamed here."  
  
"They probably said that same thing a hundred years ago," Orion pointedly stated.
