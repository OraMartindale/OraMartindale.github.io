For those who don't know, we're on the Dave Ramsey plan for paying off our debt. We started by exercising my stock options and knocked out our credit cards and a good portion of our van's loan.   
  
Today we paid off the van! Dave Ramsey always asks his callers if the vehicle drives differently now. I don't know about that yet, but it sure looks nicer!
