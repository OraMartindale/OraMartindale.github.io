My son and I jumped into the van to run some errands. It was a slightly overcast day and calm. I heard a low noise and stopped. _What is that?_ I thought to myself. "Wait here," I told Ora.  
  
I ran into the house and stopped the episode of LOST my wife was watching. Every channel was announcing a tornado warning for our area. I ran back outside and got Ora out of his seat. "Run inside," I told him firmly.  
  
"Why?"  
  
"There are tornado warnings. We need to stay here and make sure it's safe."  
  
Apparently my terse warning had quite an effect because he spent the next hour watching weather reports with us and we spent them time reassuring him that everything was going to be okay.  
  
Eventually the storm passed. Gary Lezack, the local weather man, was showing the hail that had landed outside their building. He told his assistant to put the hail in the freezer. Who keeps hail?
