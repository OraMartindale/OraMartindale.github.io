I've been looking for a good Christmas album for several years. It's really an impossible goal. I have so many songs from so many different artists that I love that to find them on an album would impossible. To find them on 10 different albums would be highly improbable.
  

  
When pondering how to find the songs I'd like, I realized that there was no need to buy albums of Christmas music. With Apple's iTunes Music Store  i can find the music and want and create my own album. So now we have 21 of our favorite Christmas songs including classics by Frank, Dean and Nat as well as newer ones by the Barenaked Ladies, Trans-Siberian Orchestra and Brian Setzer Orchestra.
