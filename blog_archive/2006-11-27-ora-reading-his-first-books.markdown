We bought Ora some "Bob books." They are simple books and he can read them himself. Enid warned me they were also simple enough that Ora could memorize them and would get lazy and not read them or guess what the next word was.  
  
Ora was reading one to me when we came to page that had two sad people on it. The text said "Sad Sam. Sad Mat." The next page had Sam and Mat sitting happily. The page said "Sam sat. Mat sat." However, Ora was already trying to anticipate without reading: "Sam Happy. Mat Happy," he said.
