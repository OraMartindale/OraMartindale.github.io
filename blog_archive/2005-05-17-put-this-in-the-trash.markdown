Enid heard that very young children can understand a lot more than we think they can, so she tried a little experiment. After eating a popsicle with Aspen, she told Aspen "Put this in the trash" and handed her the popsicle wrapper. Aspen took the wrapper and walked directly into the kitchen and tossed the wrapper into the trash.  
  
I was flored. So a couple of minutes later, when I had finished my popsicle, I asked Aspen to throw mine in the trash. Aspen took it and proceeded to the kitchen. She bumped a toy that was on the floor and it began to play music. She looked down at it squatted and picked up the toy.  
  
"Uh, oh. She got distracted," my wife said.  
  
Aspen placed the toy back down only a couple of seconds later, stood up, resumed her walk to the kitchen and then threw the wrapper away. I was even more amazed.
