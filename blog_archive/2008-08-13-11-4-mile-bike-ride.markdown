Ora 5 passed the 10-mile mark for the first time tonight as we rode an 11.4-mile ride. When we stopped for a bathroom break part way, so I pulled out the GPS and saw that we had gone 5.6 miles. Ora 5 still seemed strong so we briefly considered going farther, but decided to turn back and not push it. We're glad we did because he began to wear out the last 3 miles, but we are still amazingly proud of him.
