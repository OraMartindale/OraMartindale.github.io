In the last couple of weeks Aspen is starting to show some personality. She's beginning to emerge from that age when all babies act alike to showing us what she's going to be like when she's 2, 3 and 4.  
  
With Ora 5 we didn't know that. But looking back we can see that at Aspen's age he began to show personality traits that we see in full now, so we can look at Aspen now and glimpse who she's going to be.
