**And then there were 4**
  
It's about time that I got around to announcing this. Although most of you probably already know, Enid and I are pregnant. Wait, that's not right. Enid and I are expecting. No, that's not it either. Okay, Enid is pregnant and expecting. I'm just here. =)
  

  
She is now at week 12 with 29 weeks to go acording to AmericanBaby.com ("Hopefully more like 27 weeks," says Enid.) The due date is February 15.
  

  
We're starting to think of names, and although we have plenty of ideas for boy names, we haven't come up with much for girl names. Does that indicate anything?
  

  
Anyway, below is a pic from AmericanBaby.com  of what a baby at around 3 months would look like. At his point the baby is pretty much fully developed. From here on out it is just gaining wait and allowing the lungs to develop fully.
