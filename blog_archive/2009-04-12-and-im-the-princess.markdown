Aspen was helping set the table for dinner and asked "Why do you always sit here?"  
  
"I'm the head of the family so I sit at the head of the table," I explained.  
  
"Daddy, you're not the head. Your the king."  
  
I can live with that, I thought.  
  
"And mommies the queen and I'm the princess."
