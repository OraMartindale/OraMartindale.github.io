Still in Wal-Mart when Aspen spies a roll of pink wrapping paper with Disney Princesses on it. She ran right to it. _Great_, I thought, _princess stuff_.   
  
Aspen picked up the paper, held it at one end and then began brandishing it like a sword.  
  
"Shhha," she said as she swung it left. "Shhhu," as she swung it right.  
  
She thinks it's a lightsaber!
