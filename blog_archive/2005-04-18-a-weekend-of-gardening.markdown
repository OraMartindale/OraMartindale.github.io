This weekend was gardening weekend. We stopped by Suburban Lawn and Garden and picked up some flowering plants and worked on the area in front of our large living room window. We stopped by Wal-Mart and picked up some rose bushes and planted them in front of the houses. Enid's parents sent us some bulbs for a Japanese plant and we dug up a neglected corner of the back yard and planted those.  
  
We got a lot done and hope to see the results spring up later this summer.
