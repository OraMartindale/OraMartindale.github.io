Whenever Ora 5 wants to get on the computer he says something like "Doctor Or", "Doc Ock", or something else. We could never tell exactly what he was saying. Until today.  
  
Enid and Ora 5 were watching PBS and the commercial said "Visit us at pbs.org."  
  
"See mommy. They said dot org," Ora pointed out.  
  
_Dot Org?_ Enid thought. _That's what he is saying when he wants to play on the computer._
