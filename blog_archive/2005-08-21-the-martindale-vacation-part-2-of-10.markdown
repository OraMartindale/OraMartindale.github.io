_This is part 2 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
We left Kansas City at 8:20a.m. We packed the last of the supplies before leaving. We purchased a car-top carrier after realizing that we had so much stuff to take with us that we had packed every crevice of the car and then put stuff under the feet of both kids and in between them. Now with a car-top carrier and a new efficient packing method…we still have stuff packed under our kid’s feet and between them!  
  
We drove for a couple of hours and made our first stop at a Wal-Mart in Columbia, MO. We used the restroom and retrieved some snacks from the trunk. While we were stopped I said something, I don’t even remember what it was, and Ora said “Very Funny, Ha, Ha.” I busted out laughing. My son’s first bit of sarcasm!  
  
Our next stop was in St. Louis. We drove to the arch and I made my way to find parking. After a few wrong turns in the riverfront area, I found the Gateway Arch parking garage. The last time I was here I locked the keys in a rented Sebring convertible; a few people reading this should remember that. The garage’s clearance was 7 feet and I realized I didn’t know how tall we were with the car-top carrier, so we drove around the riverfront area again until we found a surface lot that was close. We walked to the Arch and setup a picnic --lunch in the shade of the trees beside it. Afterward we walked around the north base and took some pictures. Ora wanted to go in, but we had to get back on the road.

Our lunch must have been good because I was sleepy all the way to Mt. Vernon, Illinois. We turned south at Mt. Vernon and stopped at the best rest stop we had ever seen. It was next to Reed Lake.  It was shady, and it had quite a playground. There were even water fountains with long faucets for filling water bottles. We spent almost an hour there – twice as long as I had planned. Once back on the road both kids fell asleep. We made our last stop an hour outside Nashville. We filled up on gas and took some time to eat at Wendy’s.

Once inside Nashville we were in for a big detour. Construction diverted us from the directions we had to the hotel. We couldn’t understand the detour directions that were posted and we soon got lost. We ended up making our way into downtown Nashville. We passed many Country-music nightclubs and the Hard Rock Café. What a sight we must have been driving through Nashville’s party spots on a Friday night with a car-top carrier!  
  
We finally found our way to the hotel and arrived at 10pm. We watched a little TV and were ready for bed by 11. The one odd thing I noticed in the room was the remote control for the television. I reached to turn the TV off and the large prominent button that sits where the Power button would normally be was the “Order” button for ordering movies. I began to wonder how easy it would be to accidentally order a movie and generate revenue for the hotel with that remote!
