Marcellus posted about me now being a Soccer Dad! I don't mind being called that at all, but it made me wonder about the impressions that people have about the cars that we drive.  
  
A while back my parents lent us a 1984 van. It was large and blue and while it wasn't in great shape it wasn't the kind of thing I wanted to be seen in (sorry mom and dad). I began to think about why I didn't want to drive it and I realized it was pride. What would my coworkers think if they saw me driving a vehicle like that? It was okay if they thought of me as a mid-sized car person, but a 1984 van person? I began to realize that although I would not say that what I drive or the clothes I wear or the house I own or the neighborhood I live within or the job I have define who I am, I truly felt that they did when it came time to drive that van.  
  
Once I had identified that it was pride, I realized it wasn't a valid reason and I drove the van.  
  
When it came time to purchase a new van, I heard coworkers say things like "I would never drive a mini-van" or "Don't get a van, get a big SUV." I don't want to puff myself up or look down at others, but isn't that just pride as well?  
  
Then pride hit again when I began to look at features. I wanted the DVD system. I said if I didn't get it, that would be fine, but I really, really wanted it. But the whole time in the back of my mind lurked the fact that I wanted the DVD system, so I could say "Hey look what _my_ van has." Again it boils down to pride. It's probably good that I couldn't afford some of my favorite features.  
  
So, I don't mind being a "soccer dad" or any other moniker. I am really liking our van.
