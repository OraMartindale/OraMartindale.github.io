Spoiler warning: I'm going to spoil The Iliad for you. If you don't want it spoiled don't read the next paragraph of this post.
  

  
Two events in the last two days have conspired against me to post this. The first was reading The Iliad. Achilles' anger is the theme of the book. He is first angered because his spoils of war were taken from him. He refuses to fight against the Trojans and entreats the "gods" to give the Trojans victory so that he may have his revenge. The unforseen result of this is that his best friend is killed in battle. The second event was reading some articles on Wired that talked about Exploration, both of space and sea.
  

  
I really like science and everytime I read about robotics or space or many science related things, I get very excited; however, I took only the minimum science requirements in high school and nothing (outside of Computer Science) in college. The reason is a teacher. A teacher I hated. I hated this teacher to the point that I would not take science classes from him/her. This meant that I would not take Chemistry or any of the higher science classes and also eliminated me from being able to have Validictorian or Salutatorian honors. I feel I could have been either of those had I not been such a jerk my freshman and sophomore years.
  

  
Teachers have quite an influence on us. I love history. Part of it is because my dad loved history as well, but I also had a wonderful history teacher in high school. Enid did not and doesn't like history. Although, I didn't have near the acrimony towards my band teacher as I did my science teacher, I didn't stay in band because of my relationship with him. Enid had a wonderful band teacher and has been able to do great things in her Flute playing. I was pretty good on an instrument that not a lot of people played (Tuba), so how much different would my life be now if I had stuck with band and gone on with it in college?
  

  
However, it would not be fair to blame a teacher. I needed to get over it and place myself under the teacher's authority and learn. My anger as a teenager has influenced the direction of my life.
  

  
So now, as I look at my life and wonder why I am not a scientist or robotic engineer, I can only admit that it was decisions that I made to be angry that I'm not working in those other fields.
