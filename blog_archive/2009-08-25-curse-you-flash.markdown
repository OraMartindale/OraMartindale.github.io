I was surfing the web using my iPod Touch when Ora 5 came and sat by me to watch. "Can you go to any website with that, Dad?"  
  
"Yeah, I can go to any website I want on this."  
  
"What about Webkinz?"  
  
"Um, no. Webkinz doesn't work because it uses Flash." (iPhones and iPod Touches can't display Flash.)  
  
"What about PBSKids.org?"  
  
"Um, no. PBS Kids uses Flash too."  
  
Ora 5 then did his best Captain Kirk yelling at Kahn voice: "Curse You Flash!"
