I decided that I would keep a record of books I have read or listened to; not to tout my own reading accomplishments, but because I have trouble remembering how many books I have read or listened to over the last few years. So when I finish a book, I'll post a brief note about it.  
  
State of Fear is probably best known as Crichton's treatise against the science of global warming. He includes many citations and even a couple of appendices to support his points.  
  
The climax of the book involves a plot to create a tsunami. The book was released in 2004: Before the Asian tsunami. The timeliness is interesting.  
  
I read once that Jerry Jenkins believes that few people will sit down to read the news or inform themselves about any particular topic, but many will read fiction or watch movies. Therefore, public knowledge and thought will be driven more by what they read and watch for entertainment than by what they see in the news or read in a scientific journal.  
  
This premise is born our in Jenkins own Left Behind series in which he and Tim LeHaye teach eschatology through fiction. They have followed up that work with _The Jesus Chronicles: John's Story: The Last Eyewitness_ which is the story of the apostle John's life told as historical drama.  
  
State of Fear falls into this same category: teaching the author's belief while telling a fictional story and will probably have more impact than 1,000 scientific journal articles to the contrary.
