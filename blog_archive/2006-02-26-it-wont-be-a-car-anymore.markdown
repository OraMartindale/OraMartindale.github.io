On the way home tonight my son declared that he needed to go to the restroom.  
  
Dad: "We're almost home, Ora. Wait just a minute."  
  
Ora: "I don't want to pee at home. Stop somewhere else."  
  
Dad: "We're almost home, Ora. You can go there."  
  
Ora: "I'll pee in the car and then it won't be a car anymore!"
