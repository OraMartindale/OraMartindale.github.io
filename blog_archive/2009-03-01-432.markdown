[![1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1169231640m/39020.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus) [1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus) by [Charles C. Mann](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22004.Charles_C_Mann)  
  
Good read. The author's main premise is that before Europeans arrived there were many more Indians than were previously believed and that rather than living lightly on the land, they were very sophisticated civilizations that transformed their land to their needs.  
  
Although this isn't a popular with some groups who would prefer to see a different view of American Indians, the author does an excellent job of documenting a new view of what America once looked like.
