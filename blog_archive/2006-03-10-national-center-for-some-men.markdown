The National Center for Men brought suit today in what they are calling "Roe v. Wade for Men." They've carefully selected a young man who is paying child support for a child he says that he never wanted to a mother who claimed she could not get pregnant. They want men to not have to pay for children they fathered. There are three points that bother me:  


  

  1. They don't represent me: My mom used to call NOW the National Organization of _Some_ Women. The name of this organization implies that the represent all women when they represent a minority of women. Now I feel the same. There is an organization that portends to represent men, but hey certainly don't represent me.
  

  2. This action promotes abortion: In a [1992 article Dave Gross wrote](http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Misc/rrights.html) that men should support abortion for this very reason. The National Center for Men wants men to be allowed to refuse child support soon enough for the baby to be aborted. Some want to take it further than that and want courts to force a woman to choose between getting an abortion or forfeit future child support.
  

  3. Woman are using arguments they disputed at one time. I was listening to NPR on the way home and they quoted a woman as saying that a man had a choice before having sex, he had a choice to you contraceptives or not and that by the time she was pregnant he was out of choices. This sounds like an argument against abortion that _some_ women's organizations would take issue with if men's organizations said it.
