Ora's voice was a little strained today. So Enid commented to me "Yeah, he's got a little frog in his throat."  
  
"I have a frog in my ear," Ora corrected.  
  
I laughed. Aspen walked up to Ora and looked into his ear. She then looked at me and tugged on her shirt saying "Wan frog shirt, too."  
  
"You want a frog in your shirt too?" I asked.  
  
"Yes."  
  
"I have a frog in my nose," Ora continued. Not getting a laugh from me, he proceeded with "I have a frog in my brain." Still not getting a laugh, he said "I have frogs in my arms" and laughed at his own joke.
