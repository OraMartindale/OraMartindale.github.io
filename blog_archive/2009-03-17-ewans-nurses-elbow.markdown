Enid took the kids to a place that watches your kids while you do errands today. Ewan took a fall and was holding his arm afterward and was in obvious pain. After watching it for a while Enid took him into Children's Mercy Hospital. The Diagnosis: [Nursemaid's Elbow](http://www.emedicinehealth.com/nursemaid_elbow/article_em.htm#Nursemaid%20Elbow%20Overview), which Ora 5 had had when he was that age so we are very familiar with it. We were thankful that it wasn't worse.
