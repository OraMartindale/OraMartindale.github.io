_This is part 4 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
**A Better Start**  
This morning was a better start. Enid, Ora, and I got a shower and then had breakfast. I then started on a second attempt to setup the canopy. It went better this time, but we found we were missing a section of the center pole. After searching for a while, we asked Ora if he had seen it. “I threw it in the river,” came his reply. We asked him to show us, and he led us to the edge of the river and then pantomimed how he had rid us of it. I looked up and down the bank for a couple of minutes, but the trees on the bank prevented me from looking very far down stream. We took him at his word and found a way to prop up the remaining, shortened pole: We stacked two of our camp boxes and placed the pole on top.  
  
We then headed out for the day (it was almost noon by this point). We bought groceries and bottled water at an Ingles. I noticed that the bottled water was Ingles’ own brand and based on that and the style of the stores, it appeared that Ingles was like a Hy-Vee of North Carolina.  
  
**A long detour**  
On our way back into the park we stopped to ask for good hiking trails at the visitor center that was at this entrance to the park. Beside the visitor center was a recreation of 100-year old farm and just a quarter mile down the road was the southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The guides gave us some short hiking trails and some places to stop for lunch.   
  
After a short lunch we made our way over the top once again and tried to get to Coves, which was at the furthest extremity of the park from where we were. We didn’t realize how long it would take to get there. It takes an hour to get the 30 miles from the south entrance to the north entrance. It was at the north entrance that we realized that it was another 30 miles to the Coves. It was already almost 3:30 and we realized that to see the Coves and then get back to camp and begin supper would take a long time. We adjusted our plans and decided we would go to Clingman’s Dome today instead.  
  
I read a CNN.com article later that said that Smokey Mountain NP is the most visited national park (I thought it was Yellowstone!) and the Coves were the most popular part of that park. During heavy tourist season it can take 3-4 hours of bumper-to-bumper traffic to get through the Coves. I’m glad we decided not to attempt it that day.  
  
**In the clouds**  
We drove back up to the top and took a turn along a road that twisted and turned along the top of a ridge. We arrived at a parking area and you could see for miles. There were large numbers of trees that were dead. Later we would learn that there is a parasitic insect that is killing the trees.  
  
We decided to take a half-mile walk to the top of the mountain. The trail maps said it was steep. That was an understatement. It was a strenuous uphill climb, and we had to stop a lot both so Ora  could rest and Enid and I could as well. When we finally reached the top, we found Clingman’s dome, a large, round viewing platform that could be reached on a circular ramp. While we were on our hike and while on the top of the mountain clouds continued to rollover the mountain and envelope us. On Clingman’s dome this would result in moments of beautiful panoramas followed by blankets of thick fog.

**Back to Camp**  
After our explorations we headed back to camp. This time we found the right way to the camp by going all the way into and through Bryson City. As we approached the corner on which we were to turn I saw a cop car out of the corner of my eye. My heart skipped and I checked my speed my turn signals and everything else one does when they feel suddenly guilty by the presence of a cop. But then I noticed that the cop car was old; it looked like a cop car from Mayberry.  
  
When we reached our campsite, we saw that we had new neighbors. To our left there were two tents for a church group. To our right we two other tents: One occupied by what appeared to be a older 20-something man and his much younger brother (or maybe father and son?) and then a young couple with an older man. They may have been Indian (as in India not Native American), but I’m not very good at identifying nationalities.  
  
I began working on the first fire of the trip. I wasn’t having very good luck. I made several attempts, but couldn’t get anything started. My first attempt was to use lighter fluid. I doused all the wood in it and then lit it. The lighter fluid burned off so quickly that nothing had time to light. I gave it another attempt with paper, but it would also not stay lit long enough to light the wood. The brothers came over and donated some fireworks. I placed them in the center of my pile of wood and lit them up. It went up spectacularly, but didn’t light the fire. On my fourth attempt, I rolled up the paper tight so it would take longer to burn and that was enough to get the wood burning. Then it was time for hot dogs and smores.
