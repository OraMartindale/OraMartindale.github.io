Our washing machine died this weekend, so we went to Nebraska Furniture Mart and bought a new washer and dryer (you have to have a matching set!). Today we went to see the Exteme Makeover Home. The house is done and they were moving furniture into it. We saw Michael, Paige, Ed and heard women scream when Ty came out a couple of times.  
  
On our way back from the Extreme Makeover house, Enid's phone rang. She answered and talked cryptically with her dad for a couple of minutes. She hung up and looked at me. After a bit of prying she told me that they had bought us a washer and dryer! So we called Nebrasks Furniture Mart and canceled the order, but promised to be back in to spend the money on a dish washer.  
  
Thank you mom and dad!
