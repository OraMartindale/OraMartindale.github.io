I met the family at the library after work today and Ora 5 ran up to me with a big toothy grin. I didn't figure it out at first, but then I saw that his loose tooth was gone. He had lost it at the library and now had it in an envelope.  
  
Tonight we'll be at mt parents' house, so he'll put it under his pillow there. What is the going rate for a tooth these days? I used to get 25 cents.
