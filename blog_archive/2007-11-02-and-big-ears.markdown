Aspen was drawing while in church. She looked at me and asked "Do you have two eyes?"  
  
I didn't realize that she was talking to me so Enid answered her: "Yes, daddy has two eyes." Aspen proceeded to draw two eyes inside a small oval that was obviously meant to be my head.  
  
"And one nose?" Aspen asked.  
  
"Yes," Enid answered. Apsen drew a nose.  
  
Enid didn't hear what she said next: "And big ears." She then drew two large ears that where larger than the oval that was my head. "Daddy looks like a mouse," she declared.  
  
Enid looked down at Aspen's progress and began to laugh.
