I picked up some books at the library today and noticed they were shuffling people away from the front desk to the self-checkout computers which I usually use anyone. You have to go to the front desk to get any books you have on hold. When I did that, the librarian grabbed my books and noticed a line was forming behind me. She asked if I would step over to the self-checkout computer and to that. I agreed and noticed she did the same thing the next couple people in line. I wonder if they will be doing less checking out up front or if this is just a measure to get a long line shortened quickly.
