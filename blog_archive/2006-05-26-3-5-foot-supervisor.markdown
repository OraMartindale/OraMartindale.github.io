Papa came up this weekend to bring a bunk bed for Ora and to help me install a new garage door opener. I wasn't there when the bed was brought in and put together, but Enid tells me that Ora supervised:  
  
"Look out for the piano."  
  
"Don't hit my toolbox."  
  
"There's Aspen. Don't run into Aspen."
