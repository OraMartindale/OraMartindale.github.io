**Cheapskate Update**
  
I went back and took a look at the steps in [Mary Hunt's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805417702/qid=1054175821/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7713777-8991110?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) again, and noticed I had rearranged the order slightly and left some things out. So here's the corrections with commentary on new stuff.
  
1. Keep a daily spending record. Write down everything you spend including all bills. This will be used later in step 6.
  
2. Tithe
  
3. Save
  
4. Rapid-Debt Repayment (This is what she calls the snowball method I mentioned in a previous post.)
  
5. Freedom Account
  
6. Create a monthly spending plan. Use your daily spending record to create a plan for how your money is spent on a monthly basis. Continue keeping a daily spending record and adjust the monthly spending plan as needed. Ms. Hunt calls it a plan rather than a "budget" intentionally. Budget sounds bad. "Good things are done with a plan. Battles are won, houses are built, and games are won."
  
7. Reduce Spending. I counted her list of suggestions. There were 348 of them! Some common sense, but all of them really good.
  

  
One thing she mentioned for a Freedom sub-account is your insurance deductibles. You can reduce the premiums you pay for insurance policies but raising your deductible. If you plan for this in your Freedom Account, you can have the deductible ready when the time comes. For example, if you have a $250 deductible on an insurance policy, you could create a Freedom sub-account to collect for a $500 deductible. Once you had reached that amount in your Freedom Account you can raise the deductible to the $500 level. If you so desired, you could continue to contribute to your Freedom sub-account until it reached $1000 and then raise your deductible again. You would be paying lower premiums as well, so the extra money could go to your Rapid-Debt Repayment plan or to fund the Freedom Account faster.
  

  
I highly recommend [buying her book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805417702/qid=1054175821/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7713777-8991110?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and checking out [her website](http://www.cheapskatemonthly.com/). If you would like to buy from a more worthy organization, you can pick up her other book [Debt Proof Living](http://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=1615) from Focus on the Family.
