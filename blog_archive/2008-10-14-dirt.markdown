My brother-in-law and I were talking about how we both need dirt to shore up some low spots around our houses yesterday; however, the expense of doing so was prohibitive. Today he called and asked if I could look on Craigslist and find any places giving away dirt. Sure enough: I found several places giving away free dirt. 2 hours later he was at my house with a large trailer filled with dirt!
