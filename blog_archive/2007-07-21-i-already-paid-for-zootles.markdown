Enid and I were talking about Ora 5's Zootles subscription.  
  
"I already paid for Zootles," Ora 5 interjected. "The mailman came and took it already." He was smiling, obviously pleased with himself.  
  
What he didn't know was that I had found the envelope that he had placed 36 cents within and I took it out of the outgoing mail.
