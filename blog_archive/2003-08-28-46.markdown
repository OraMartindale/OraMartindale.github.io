**[Tribond](http://www.tribond.com/): Holocaust, Constitution, Kansas City**
  
I wanted to mention an article that was in the KC Star a few weeks back. The Liberty Memorial is complete and planning is well underway for the Museum that will be housed under the memorial. As you walk in there will be a field of poppies that represent the millions of people who were killed in The Great War. The article also said that the poppies would have "other signifcance" when people left. Inside there will be a "technology-rich" museum. 
  

  
Behind the large wall that faces Union Station, will be one large room. Images will be projected on a screen that is described as twice as wide as a IMAX screen. In the room will be statues of people watching the images and benches for sitting. As you sit on a bench it will activate a recorded story of someone telling their experience during the war. In the back of the room, a row of cannons will face the screen of images.
  

  
This all sounded very interesting, but what sold me was the company making the proposal. Their name is strangely never mentioned in the article, but it says they also desinged the [United States Holocaust Museum](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/) in Washington, D.C. and the [Constitution Center](http://constitutioncenter.org/) in Philladelphia which opened this year on July 4th.
  

  
I visited the Holocaust Museum several years ago. It is probably one of the most well-planned experiences you can have. They welcomed us to the museum with an introduction to the building. The building is designed to be uncomfortable. The structure is brick and steel. The temperature is intentionally 5 degrees colder than it should be. All of this is to create an atmosphere where the discomfort you feel in seeing the museum displays is hightened by your physical discomfort in your surroundings. I don't know if they explain this to everyone who comes through or just large groups like ours.
  

  
The next thing they did was give us a pamphlet. On the cover was the face and name of someone who lived during the time of the Holocaust. We were instructed to only open one page of the pamphlet per floor. There were four floors each representing a time period of the Holocaust. Each page of the pamplet told a bit about the person, thier life before the Holocaust, where they lived, how they were treated and their journey through World War Two.
  

  
We walked through the museum. In some places there were the usual walls of informational pictures, documents, etc. In others we actually walked through a box car that was used to transport people to extermination camps. A boat that helped smuggle people out of Germany filled one room ([shown here](http://www.ushmm.org/photos/alpha/n02472.jpg)). Another room was a recreation of a bunk house made from the beds and walls used in Auschwitz ([shown here](http://www.ushmm.org/photos/alpha/n02444.jpg) and [here](http://www.ushmm.org/photos/alpha/n02448.jpg)). Some people could not handle walking through these exhibits. In other portions there would be four-foot tall cement walls surrounding TV monitors ([shown here](http://www.ushmm.org/photos/alpha/n02430.jpg)). The cement walls were meant to protect children or anyone who chose not to see what was on the monitors. The footage was graphic. Some showed the work they did in camps, some showed their living quarters, some showed bodies being tossed or bulldozed into mass graves, some showed the discover of those bodies.
  

  
As we walked through, four of us together followed the lives of the four people on our pamphlets. When we reached the end, we were in a round room with candles against the walls. It felt like a sanctuary. At this point we were to reveal the outcomes of the lives we had followed. "She died," one said half surprised and half expecting it. "Mine too," said another. "Same with mine." "Mine lived." Three sets of eyes darted up to the fourth. We crouched around to see how the lone survior from our group had lived out the rest of her life. ([See the Hall of Remembrance](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/a_and_a/index.utp?content=inside_c/right.htm).)
  

  
Tears were shed. Some lit candles in memorial. We didn't understand how we could become so emotionally attached and involved with someone we had only known on paper for the last couple of hours. We stayed in the sactuary for a few more minutes looking over the lives of our companions through our journey.
  

  
This is the same company that will come to Kansas City and take us on a journey through World War One. I know that people today haven't invested as  much emotion into World War One as they have the Holocaust; however, I am excited when I think of what they will do here. I think back to my experience in the sactuary and wonder if sitting on a bench in the great room under Liberty Memorial and hearing how someone's life was touched by the war will be a similar experience. I think about the poppies "other significance" and wonder what perspective changes, like the companion on the pamphlet, our museum will hold for us.
