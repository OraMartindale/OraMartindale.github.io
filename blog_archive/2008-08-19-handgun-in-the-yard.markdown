We were about to go eat this evening (since the fridge had no edible leftovers) when our neighbor came over and told us that Saturday night a police chase had sent cars speeding down our street and the perps were throwing guns out the window. In his yard he found a loaded magazine and random bullets and in our yard the police found a loaded handgun. We were at a friend's house on Saturday, so we didn't know any of this.  
  
He recommended we look through our yard to make sure that there wasn't anything else. He didn't want one of the kids to find it or for me to mow over a bullet. So I did several laps across the front 10 feet of our yard, but found nothing. As I was about to quit, Enid pointed to the bush by the driveway and asked if what she saw was a gun. It was.  
  
I sent everyone into the house and called 911 and told them what I had found and that was were told it was probably the result of a police chase. The 911 voice took my information and then asked if I would be home for a while. I told them we would wait until the police got there. I didn't want someone coming back for the gun or a curious kid to get it. This was about 6:30pm.  
  
At 7:15, I called the local police station who transferred me to the non-emergency police line. I explained my situation again and asked when I could expect someone. She explained that they were very busy and would get to us as soon as they could. I sent Enid to get food for the kids and continued to wait.  
  
At 10:10, I called the main Kansas City Police number and was again transferred to the non-emergency number. I got a message saying everyone was busy at the moment, but please stay on the line. In about a minute the same person that I spoke to at 7:15 answered.. As soon as I said I had a called earlier about a gun in my yard, the woman said "Yes," in a tone that indicated she remembered me; not unpleasant, but obviously concerned that I was helped yet. "Can you give me your address again?" I did and she asked me to hold on. 3 minutes later she was back on the phone and said she was sending someone right out.  
  
I waited for about 10 more minutes and Officer McCuffinn arrived. He said at the time I first called there was a shooting in the Metro and everyone was over there; he had just finished there when I called the police the last time.  
  
He retrieved the gun, pulled out a full magazine and removed the round from the chamber. A second police car pulled up and Officer McCuffinn asked the new arrival if he had an evidence bag. He pulled out a white envelope that looked like an inter-office memo envelope except that on one side it said "Handgun Bag." He placed the magazine back into the gun and then placed it and the removed bullet into the bag. I don't know much about guns, but this made me nervous, because my perception is that when you load the magazine it will automatically load a round into the chamber, but maybe you need to do that manually.  
  
While the officers were doing this, our neighborhood's security patrol drove by. He slowed down and asked if everything was okay. Officer McCuffinn gave him a thumbs up and smiled somewhat dismissively.  
  
The officer then asked me for a bunch of contact information in case they needed to get ahold of me and confirmed that they did have a police chase there on Saturday. The police had abandoned the chase for fear of causing an accident, but the perps continued speeding through the neighborhood discarding items. They eventually had a head-on collision.  
  
He also struggled to find words to say "they were not upstanding people."  
  
"Were they known to you?" I asked.  
  
"Yeah."  
  
"Anyone from around this neighborhood?" I asked trying to feel out if I should be concerned about my neighbors.  
  
"One was from [street 4 blocks North]. He's already been arrested with a gun before, so if he had a gun this time, he won't be... Well, it doesn't matter now. He's dead."  
  
He then went on to explain that one had died and the other was in critical condition in the hospital. He also said that he rarely gets calls about our neighborhood it's just one of those things that happens in your neighborhood by chance but doesn't indicate a trend. This was good to here and confirmed my own observations about our street and neighbors.
