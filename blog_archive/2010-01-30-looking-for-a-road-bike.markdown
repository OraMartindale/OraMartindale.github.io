My new company participates in the Kansas City Corporate Challenge and I began thinking about competing in the Bicycle Road Race; however, when I saw last years results, I realized that the best in this competition are keeping a steady pace of 30 MPH on the 2.5 mile course. I'm going to need a better bike if I'm going to be even in the middle of the pack in this race. (There's not really a pack because it's a time trial event, so they space the racers out by 30 seconds.)  
  
I also found out that my boss's boss, Phil, usually wins this race in under 5 minutes. He's also bike the entire Katy Trail... all 224 miles of it... in one day!  
  
So I decided to look for a new bike. The main thing that I will need is a lighter bike. I may be able to sustain speeds of 20-25 MPH on lighter bike. So I'm on he search for an entry-level aluminum road bike. I searched several places and the prices range from $650-800 for the entry-level bikes. One place I went was Trek because they are made here in America at Madison Wisconson. (Interesting that I use that as a criteria for buying a bike, but not a car.) The guy was very helpful and said that he doesn't even like selling their entry-level bikes because the components are not very good.  
  
So after not finding a bike in my price range, I've got my RSS reader watching Craigslist for [a bike that meets my criteria](http://kansascity.craigslist.org/search/bik?query=58+aluminum%7Ccarbon&catAbbreviation=bik&minAsk=min&maxAsk=500).
