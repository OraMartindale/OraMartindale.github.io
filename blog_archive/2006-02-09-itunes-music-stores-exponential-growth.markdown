iTunes is about to hit 1 billion song downloads. To celebrate Apple has brought back the countdown and is giving away an iPod for every 100,000th song sold. An unscientific method indicated that one was being given away every 15-20 minutes.   
  
Based on reports from News.com on how many songs had been sold over the last 3 years. I decided to plot the sales curve:

If I had paid more attention in math, I would love to plot out when they would hit 1.5 and 2 billion songs.
