After Ora 5 saved to [buy himself an iPod earlier this year](http://www.blogger.com/2009/03/ora-5s-ipod-shuffle.asp) he decided his next big purchase would be a Nintendo DS Lite. Today he got it. He saved $110 in less than 5 months and I took him to GameStop to buy a refurbed black DS Lite with Pokemon characters etched into the case.  
  
He's playing Kirby non-stop.
