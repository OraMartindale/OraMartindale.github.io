Enid and the kids took the car today and dropped me off at work. On the way out of the parking lot Ora began to give mom the rules for driving:  
  
1. Don't drive on the sidewalk.  
  
2. Don't hit the curb.  
  
3. Don't run over the flowers.  
  
4. Don't pee on the sidewalk.  
  
Enid: "What?! Don't pee on the sidewalk?"  
  
Ora 5: "No, don't write P's on the sidewalk."  
  
Enid" "Why do you say that?"  
  
Ora 5: "Because the sign has P with a circle and line across it."
