The weather called for blizzard conditions, so the boss started sending people home today around 1:30. One co-worker with a sporty car with low-profile tires couldn't make it down the unplowed frontage road that we work on and had to turn back. I decided I should get out while I could. The frontage road was bad with lots of snow shoved around by cars, but not plowed. I had my car in the lowest gear and just trudged through the snow. At parts it was like a one-lane road and you'd have to carefully move to the side to let cars pass.

The highway was much better. Though not cleared, it was plowed so I didn't have to contend with with piles of snow. But the wind was making visibility very difficult. At one point I lost site of the car in front of me only to have him reappear at half the distance he had been.

My final challenge was my own street. Still covered in snow piles that were even higher that the frontage road. Since few cars run this road, there weren't tire tracks for me to follow. But I made it.

I texted my coworker to say: Home!
