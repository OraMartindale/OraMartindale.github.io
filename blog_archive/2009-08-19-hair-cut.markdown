Occasionally on our drive home, we'll take a different street to get to our house; although it is longer the kids have taken to calling this the "shortcut" and they like the change in pace.  
  
As we drive home tonight, Ewan began chanting "hair-cut. hair-cut. hair-cut."  
  
"Do you want a haircut?" I inquired.  
  
"Um-hmm."  
  
"But you just had a haircut."  
  
"hair-cut. hair-cut. hair-cut."  
  
"Do you mean 'shortcut?'"  
  
"Yeah."
