The KC Star had an article today quoting a couple of Chiefs executives saying that if we vote No on Question 1, they will ask for a new stadium next. That's okay with me. I'll vote for that!  
  
I also thought a bit more about what I posted yesterday. I said "Loose the Teams!" but I don't believe we will lose the teams. If we vote No the city, county and teams will come back with a new plan. They keep saying there is no next plan, but if April 4th brings back a No than you can bet that a new next plan will be drawn up fast.  
  
So I'm ammending what I said. I now say: "Keep the Teams! Vote NO!"   
  
You may be thinking that this new phrase will cause confusion and my cause some people who are in favor of voting Yes because they think it will keep the teams to vote No. Good!
