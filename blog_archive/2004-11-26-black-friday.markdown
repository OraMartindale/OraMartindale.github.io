Traffic was one-way everywhere you looked. Even the back roads were tough to navigate. Areas that were once large thoroughfares were now down to a couple of lines each direction. My wife and I separated and tried to find our way through separately and reconnected when our destination was reached. Thanksgiving day traffic with 30,699,996 other people? Nope. Wal-Mart's day-after-Thanksgiving sales.
  

  
When we're in Salina, we like to do the day-after-Thanksgiving sales. (Smaller crowds than in KC.) So we got up at 5 and drug Aspen to Wal-Mart. It was fun. They had pallets wrapped in black plastic and at 6am they ripped them open and all the shopper grabbed what they could as quickly as they could. Aisles were clogged and running slow, but everyone was in a Christmas cheer mood.
  

  
By 6:20am, we were loading our loot in the car with almost all our Christmas shopping done; a lot of it before Thanksgiving. =)
