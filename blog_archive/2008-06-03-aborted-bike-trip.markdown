After dinner I began loading the bikes onto the van, but noticed that clouds were rolling in. I went into the house and Enid had the weather radio on which was reporting that there were already severe storms in the city, so I unpacked the bikes.  
  
Less than 30 minutes later, the rain was pouring down. We'll try again tomorrow.
