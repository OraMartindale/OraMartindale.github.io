In the past couple of weeks Ewan has been saying a lot of words. It takes a mother or father (or even a sibling's) interpretation to understand the words, but we can recognize what he is saying.  
  
One of my favorites is "house." He will go to the computer, point to the browser and say "house." It's his way of telling us he wants to click on the "Home" button to go to the browsers home page. (Our home page is a landing page for the kids to find all their favorite sites.)  
  
The one word that we hadn't heard yet is "Please." Today, when I got home, Enid told me that he finally said it.
