After church and lunch we went for a drive around Longview Lake to see if we could find campgrounds. We stumbled across a new subdivision going up and were struck by the designs. The area is called [New Longview](http://www.newlongview.com/) and we noticed right away that the streets were narrow, the houses were packed quite close together, every house had a front porch and not a single one had a garage in the front. All the garages were tucked away behind the house and separated from the houses. To access them you had to go down and alley that was only large enough for one car to pass through.  
  
My dad had always complained that the major feature on most houses is the garage. This disdain for architecture that highlighted garages was passed down to me so this new section immediately caught my eye. We toured several of the houses which the sales lady told me ranged from $200,000 to $1,000,000. As I looked at everything I loved about the houses and neighborhood, I began to convince myself that although the least expensive houses could be the upper range of what I could afford, I could make it work. The sales lady did her best to convince me as well.  
  
Apparently this subdivision is a style of urban planning called [New Urbanism](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/newurbanism/). It's tenants are: walkability (work, school, playground, shopping all within 5 minutes walk), de-emphasize the car (narrow roads, hide garages) and diverse income levels. While $200,000 for the cheapest house isn't exactly including all income levels, there aren't many neighborhoods where one neighbor's house costs 5 times another neighbors.  
  
My mom commented that the neighborhood looked like it was a TV set. I took a second look at it and agreed: It did look like a row of houses on a TV set. In fact _The Truman Show_ was filmed in a city that had been built by New Urbanism architects.  
  
We went to the playground (less than a one-minute walk) and let Ora and Aspen play. Another couple about 5 years older than us with 3 kids came to play. They had been looking at the same model homes we had. I wondered how they were going to afford a place here. _They probably both work_, I thought to myself. _And they probably don't tithe._ These were the same things I reminded Enid whenever she asked how other families could afford some things.  
  
I went home and pulled up a mortgage calculator. If I paid off all my credit cards... and my student loans... and got a really good raise... I still couldn't afford those houses. I like the ideas of New Urbanism and if you're ever over by Longview Farms you should stop and take a look. But I reminded myself that this is not my home: [Mark 8:36](http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Mark+8%3A36&section=0&version=nas) and [John 14:2-3](http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=John+14%3A2-3&section=0&version=nas&new=1&amp;oq=&NavBook=mr&NavGo=8&NavCurrentChapter=8).
