I was at the CF United conference in Washington D.C. last month. During a break one afternoon, I ran downtown. I have been to DC three times before and the only think that I have found missing in my tours of our nation's capitol is seeing the Library of Congress.  
  
I took the Metro to Union Station and headed to the Capitol Building. Due to construction, I had to make a large detour around a fenced construction area and suddenly found myself in front of the Supreme Court. Cameras from every new network were setup facing the building waiting for a decision on President Bush's Gitmo prisoners. I looked around and realized that though I had been here before, I did not recognize it.  
  
11 years ago I had stood in the middle of what was now a construction mess waiting for a friend. It was a beautiful spot with large trees and open grassy area. You could look from the steps of the Capitol over to the Library and the Supreme Court. My friend emerged from the Capitol and said her congressperson had offered her a Coke. I argued it should be called "pop" not "Coke". Another person from our group who hailed from New Jersey joined us.  
  
"What do you call it?" I quizzed.  
  
"Soda."  
  
"Well, at least that's better than Coke." Another person in our group from Iowa joined us. "Is it a soda or pop?" I asked.  
  
"Pop."  
  
"Thank you."  
  
After our conversation I walked across the large tree-covered lawn to the Supreme Court. The cameras were there that day for a different reason: Former Chief Justice Warren Burger had died and his body laid in rest in the Supreme Court. I walked up the steps of the Supreme Court and joined the line of people to see him.  
  
Now, I stood looking at a large ugly construction site. The green lawn was gone. The trees were gone. The inviting landscape that ushered visitors into the Capitol were gone. Each street that had Senator's offices had large barriers to keep cars from going through without stopping at security checkpoints that I don't remember from 11 years ago. Washington, D.C. was a different city and not for the better.
