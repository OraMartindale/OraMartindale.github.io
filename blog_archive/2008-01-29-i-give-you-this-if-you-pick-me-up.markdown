Ewan was awake early this morning and he walked up to me holding part of Ora 5's flashlight. He held it up to me. I took it and explained what it was to him and then handed it back to him. He looked at it quizzically, set it down and then held up his hands to me.  
  
"Oh," I said. "I give you this, if you pick me up. Is that how this works?"  
  
His arms stayed extended and I dutifully picked him up.
