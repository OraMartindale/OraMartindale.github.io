We had our first snow of the year last night. 6 inches. It knocked out power to our office, so we were on backup generators. Since I arrive an hour before most people, I was able to draw a little juice and get some work done. However, by 8, enough people were trying to get on their computers that none of the computers were working.
  

  
So my group gathered for a meeting that we could hold without our computers. After that we had nothing to do. Since one of my co-workers was visiting relatives after work, he had brought a poker set and since we had nothing else to do we started to play.
  

  
Well word quickly spread around the office and within an hour the higher ups at our home office 177 miles away had heard and called the higher ups at our office to put a stop to it. So what is thier suggestion that we do when we can't work? Busy work: "Why don't you clean up you desks?" So that's what we did. We cleaned our desks. I'm tired of managers and ready for leaders, but they are in short supply everywhere it seems.
