**Birth of a Daughter**
  
Enid was induced on Wednesday, February 4th. I always wondered how someone decides something as significant as your child's birthday when you have the choice.
  

  
"My schedule is open on Wednesday. We'll do it then," stated Enid's OB.
  

  
Oh. That's how you decide.
  

  
Aspen arrived just after noon. We didn't know she was Aspen. Would she be Aspen or Ewan. The baby came after just 10 minutes of pushing (as compared to 1 hour, 15 minutes with Ora 5) and the doctor announced it was a girl. Enid told everyone it was Aspen Grace Martindale.
  

  
After a few minutes under the heating lamp checking her breathing Enid had a few minutes with her. Since Enid's epidural came late it hadn't helped Enid nor made Aspen sleepy. The took Aspen away for further observation to keep an eye on her breathing.
  

  
We called Oma and she and Ora 5 rushed to see the new sister.
