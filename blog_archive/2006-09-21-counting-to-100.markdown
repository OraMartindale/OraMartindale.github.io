I've taken off 3 weeks from work to let Enid get adjusted to being at home again. While home I've taken over Ora's homeschooling. We were outside today and I was pushing Ora and Aspen on the swing and decided to take the opportunity to practice counting. I had Ora count the times I pushed him. We've been working on 14 and 15, so I helped him through the teens, but once he got to 20 he kept going: "21, 22, 23, 24..." Since I had counted to 30 for him before I wasn't too surprised, but impressed.   
  
"28, 29... What comes after 29?" he asked.  
  
"30."  
  
"30, 31, 32, 33..." he continued. This we hadn't worked on, so I was impressed that he understood that you could simply append 1, 2, 3, so on to 30 and keep going.  
  
"38, 39... What comes after 39?"  
  
"40."  
  
"40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49."  
  
"50," I said anticipating his question.  
  
"50, 51, 52..." He kept on going with my helps at each 10 until... "98, 99."  
  
"100."  
  
"100."  
  
"Ora, you just counted to 100!" We yelled and celebrated at the top of our voices.  
  
"Let's jump on the trampoline now," Ora suggested. I was eager to see if he would count to 100 again, so we started over counting jumps and he counted to 100 jumps!
