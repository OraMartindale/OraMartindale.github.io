About a month ago there was a family on the news. They had been in a car wreck in Indiana on their way back from Disney World. Apparently the teenage daughter was driving and began to get to near the shoulder. Her father warned her and she overcorrected, rolling the car. Two died and the rest went to the hospital.  
  
I remember driving on family vacations. I remember driving 100 MPH accross the salt flats of Utah. I remember driving on twisty eastern-state roads and mom screamed that I was too close to the shoulder and dad ordered me out of the drivers seat.  
  
I take for granted that I got to drive on vacations and that someday I would let my kids do the same. I'm sure the father in this accident didn't think anything of letting his daughter drive and now two in their family are dead.
