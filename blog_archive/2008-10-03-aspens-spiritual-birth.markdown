Aspen asked to read her Bible tonight for her bedtime story. She flipped through a few pages and then said that she wanted to see the picture where Jesus died. I turned over the pages until I found the 2 pages that showed a distant hill with three crosses on the top.  
  
"Which one is Jesus?" she asked.  
  
"The middle one. Do you know why Jesus died on the cross?"  
  
"Yes." From there I asked her if she understood sin, if she was a sinner, asked her again why Jesus died and if he stayed dead. She understood everything correctly. I asked her if she believed all those things and she told me "yes." I told her that since she believed those things, she can live in Heaven some day with Mom and Dad and Jesus. Then I led her in prayer where she confirmed that she believed the salvation message.  
  
Hallelujah!

<blockquote>  
In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. (Luke 15:10)  
  
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. (Matthew 18:6)
