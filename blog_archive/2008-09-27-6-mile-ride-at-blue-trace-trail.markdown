We went for a ride on the Blue Trace Trail today. It's a bit out of the way for us, but we were eager to try a different trail. It's a gravel trail similar to the Katy Trail instead of the paved trails throughout the rest of the city.

This also marked the first time we let Aspen ride on her own. She was a bit slow but she rode for about Â¾ of a mile and then we put her back into the trailer and stashed the bike beside the trail in the tree line. I created a waypoint on my Garmin GPS and then gave it to Aspen so that she could keep track of how far we were from her bike.  
  
I then worked to catch up with Ora 5 and Enid, but soon found that they were coming back to me. A couple of us were not feeling 100% so we decided to cut the ride short and head back.

The trail was beautiful; however, the mosquitoes were horrible. They were large and every time that we stopped there would be 6 instantly swarming around us. I don't know if going earlier in the year would help, but the mosquitoes certainly may keep us from going back.
