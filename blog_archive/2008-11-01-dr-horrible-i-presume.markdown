Every year, our company has a "spirit week" during the week of Halloween. If you're thinking that sounds a bit like high school, you'd be exactly right. The one day of the week that I really like is when you dress up like your favorite character (TV, movie, etc). Last year Rick dressed as Dr. Wilson and I went as Dr. House:

This year, I decided to go as [Dr. Horrible](http://www.drhorrible.com). I looked around and found a Mad Scientist outfit at the local costume store. It was fairly close, but it had black buttons and a black belt:

I tossed the belt and removed all the black buttons and replaced them with white buttons that I bought at Wal-Mart. I also bought white welding gloves and welding goggles from Amazon.com.  
  
Rick dressed as Dr. Horrible's nemesis: Captain Hammer. We had a really good time. Dr. Horrible is known mostly to geeks, so as expected few people recognized us, but there were 3 or 4 people who instantly recognized us and, yes, they were the geeks.  
  
On Halloween night, we took our kids to the local mega-church. I wore my costume and one person recognized me there as well.
