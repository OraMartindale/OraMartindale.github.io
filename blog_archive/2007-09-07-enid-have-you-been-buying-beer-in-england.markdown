I saw 2 charges on my Bank of America account tonight that I didn't recognize. After calling customer service we determined that someone had charged something in England to Enid's debit card.  
  
"Have you done any international travel?" the customer service rep asked?  
  
I laughed. "No."  
  
"Would you like to because apparently you're getting charged for it," he quipped. I laughed out loud at that one. "Let me see what was purchased." He laughed a bit. "Okay, you're going to laugh: It's a convenience food store. [Pause] Lots of beer and snacks."
