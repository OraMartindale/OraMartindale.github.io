**MAX is over**
  
I just finished my last class and MAX is over. Most people have already left for the airport. One of my last sessions was with Ben Forta. When I started my current job, I knew nothing about Cold Fusion. I was handed a book by this guy named Ben Forta and told "This is your training." Over the last 5 years I've really appreciated all the books and articles he has written about CF and the internet overall. So I had my picture taken with him at the end of the class and expressed my gratitude to him as did several others. As I write this he is walking by.
  

  
Tonight I'm going to try to see the Olympic torch and the capitol building. Hopefully, I can bring back some good capitol pictures for Jason.
