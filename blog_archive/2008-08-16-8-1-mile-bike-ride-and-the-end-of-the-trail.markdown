We drove to Rick's house this morning and he let us through his neighborhood to jump on the Indian Creek trail. We rode 8.1 miles and I took an extra 1.5 miles reach the end of the Indian Creek trail.  
  
The trail goes by the Nazarene college in Olathe where it begins to cross roads at awkward crosswalks. It can be difficult to follow if you don't watch for the road signs which are not posted to face those riders on the trail, but rather the traffic crossing the trail.  
  
151st street is the busiest crossing and everyone went back, but I biked the last bit to see where the trail sends. The Indian Creek dwindles down to not much more than a ditch and the trail ends at a loop in a wooded park, but now I can say that I've biked the trail from end to end, just not all in the same trip.
