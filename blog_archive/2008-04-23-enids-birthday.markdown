Enid's birthday is tomorrow, but we celebrated today. We surprised her with gifts and a cake. Ora 5 handed his gift to her and Aspen said "It's a necklace."  
  
"Aspen, don't tell me," Enid told her.  
  
"Shh," I scolded.  
  
Enid opened Ora's gift to reveal a necklace.  
  
Aspen handed her first gift to mom. "It's a candle."  
  
"Aspen, don't tell mom what they are," I reminded her. Enid opened her candle.  
  
Aspen handed the next gift to her. "Now, don't say anything," I reminded Aspen. Enid opened her gift without being told what it was beforehand.   
  
I handed my gift to Enid. "Now, don't say anything," I reminded Aspen again. Enid began to open her present. In the few moments of silence as Enid opened it, Aspen said "It's a flute."
