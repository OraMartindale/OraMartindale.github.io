Worked out at the Y this morning before going into work. On my first few bike rides I have been winded and had trouble pulling the trailer, so I decided it was going to take more than biking to get in shape.   
  
I did a round on all the machines and then got on a bike and went 4 miles, hitting my target heart rate in the process. When I was done, I wasn't worn out, winded, no chest pain, etc, so apparently the biking has done me some good already.
