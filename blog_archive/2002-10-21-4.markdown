<td valign="top" >According to [Box Office Guru](http://www.boxofficeguru.com) Jonah has jumped back into the top 10 movies this weekend and made $16.2 million. CNN had called Jonah Big Idea's [$14M movie gamble](http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/04/film.veggie.tales.ap/index.html). Looks like it's going to pay off particularly when video sales, Big Idea's strong suit, begin. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to go see it sometime soon.
