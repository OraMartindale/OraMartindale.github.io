Enid took the kids out today. The first went to JC Penny's and looked for shoes for Ora.  
  
She then went to McDonalds and found that Aspen was missing a shoe, so back to JC Penny's.  There was no sign of Aspen's shoe. Enid said that the shoe department was such a mess, I imagined her asking if they had found a missing shoe among rows of unshelved shoes and getting disbelieving stares.  
  
While at JC Penny's, Enid noticed that Aspen's diaper need changed, but no diapers! So she drove to Wal-mart and bought new shoes and diapers.  
  
What a day!
