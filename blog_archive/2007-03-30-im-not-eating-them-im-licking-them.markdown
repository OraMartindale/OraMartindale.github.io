Tonight, Ora refused to eat his food. (This happens often.) We told him he had to have 5 bites of the main course and 2 bites of green beans. He wouldn't do it until he was told he would not be able to go to the movie I had planned on the family seeing tonight. He grudging ate 5 small bites of the main dish and 2 half green beans. (He had to split them to remove the "seeds."  
  
After dinner he ran outside with the salt shaker. I saw him with his back turned to me and his head down in the leaves. "Are you eating a leaf?"  
  
"I'm not eating them. I'm licking them."  
  
He won't voluntarily eat green beans, but he'll eat leaves!
