I listened to two 3 David McCullough. A couple of lines caught my attention. I'm paraphrasing: "The weather had been strange that summer. 17 people died in a tornado in Pittsburg and the tin roof of [a] church had [come off]." (The Johnstown Flood) Then in The Great Bridge he describes a rejected bridge design and how it was rejected and says "and its a good thing, because it wouldn't have worked." How much research went into those two short statements. How many weather reports did he cull through to right 2 sentences? How much did he pay an architect to review and test a 140-year-old design so he could add a statement as to whether it would have worked or not?
