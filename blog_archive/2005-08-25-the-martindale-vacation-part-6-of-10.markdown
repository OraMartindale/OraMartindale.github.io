_This is part 6 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
Aspen woke up at the same time as mom and dad. Enid wrote postcards to friends and family and I took Aspen to the bathhouse to get a shower. Enid soon heard wails of disapproval coming from the bathhouse. Aspen didn’t like showers!  
  
We began tearing down camp to prepare for heading to Asheville. It occurred to me that I didn’t know what day it was! Enid and I spent a bit of time counting up the days. "Let’s see, we left KC on Saturday; we drove two days to get here; we stayed three nights: It must be Wednesday."  
  
As we broke down camp, I found the missing pole from the canopy that Ora claimed to have thrown in the river; it was under the tent! Once the car was loaded up we headed out. As we drove through Bryson City, we saw the cop car again in the same spot. “I don’t think that cop car ever moves,” I told Enid.  
  
We stopped at the IGA grocery store and Enid ran in to get lunch supplies. She came out and showed off the Sunbeam bread she had found. (Enid’s grandfather used to work for the company that made Sunbeam bread.)

Then, after one last stop at the Great Smokey Mountain National Park gift shop, we entered the southern nexus of the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was a windy road that climbed several hundred feet in the first few miles. Along the way there were lots of tunnels. I would see a sign that said tunnel ahead and I would say “Tunnel, Ora,” and he would sit up straight in his car seat and strain to look out the front window at the upcoming tunnel.  
  
We stopped and laid out a lunch at Waterrock Knob, an overlook with beautiful views on three sides. On a clear day you can see Bryson City and Clingman’s dome from this outlook, but the “Smoke” in Smokey Mountains prevented that this day. There was also a half-mile trail you could climb to the peak of the Knob and see views in every direction. After our tough hike up Clingman’s Dome, we decided to skip this hike.  
  
We got into the car continued on the Parkway and soon came to a construction sign that said “Men Working. 25 MPG.”  
  
“Wow, they’re working fast,” Enid joked.  
  
Although we only drove 80 or 90 miles the trip took us 3 hours. At some points we entered the clouds and could not see over 50 feet in front of us.  
  
**A new campground**  
We arrived in Asheville,  drove through it and found our new campground. On our way we saw the Hotel on the Biltmore Estate, but not the Mansion itself. Our campground was on a large hill (mountain?) that overlooked the large river that ran through Asheville. The RV sites ran down the length of the hill's crest so as you walked by them on a 50 foot wide plateau, there were steep declines on both sides of you.  
  
We looked at all the tent sites and found the only one with enough room for all our stuff. In fact, all the other tent sites were not even large enough for our tent! It was also secluded since it was at the end of the row of RVs and most of them were empty.

The temperature was cooler in Asheville than it had been in Bryson City. It occurred to me that I had made the same mistake before this vacation that I had made 3 years ago before our Yellowstone vacation. On that vacation, I was unable to locate a zip code for Yellowstone to plug into Weather.com, so I found the nearest town and used its zip code. However, between the nearest town and the heart of Yellowstone, you climb several thousand feet into the caldera of the park. Therefore its temperature is quite different than the temperature of the nearest town due to the altitude change. This trip I had checked weather in Asheville and assumed Bryson City would be the same. The reality was that Bryson City was low in altitude and at the river’s lowest point and very humid. Asheville is elevated and our campground towered over the town and was much cooler.  
  
I realized that growing up in Kansas had given me a frame of reference that caused me to assume that if something were 60 miles away it would take 60 minutes to get there and the temperature would be the same as the place you had left. Vacations to both the eastern and western parts of the country had proved that false.  
  
Enid and I began setting up camp and soon the kids began entertaining themselves by throwing rocks at our car. We then took another trip to Ingles (just down the road this time). Making a fire and smores with my son ended the night.
