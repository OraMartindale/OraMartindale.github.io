Ora was at the Library playing with a little boy. Ora left for a moment and Enid heard the little boy tell his brother: "Hide me. I don't want to play with that boy."  
  
When Ora came back and looked for the boy, Enid had to explain to him that the boy didn't want to play with Ora.  
  
"But he didn't tell me," Ora protested.  
  
As Enid related the event to me, I looked back at Ora. His face showed anguish over it even now. My heart broke for Ora. I was reminded of going to a small school with only 3 boys in my class that didn't want to have anything to do with me. Now I know why mom took it so hard.  
  
You never have to teach children to be cruel. They're born knowing how to do it.
