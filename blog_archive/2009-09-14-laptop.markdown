The family picked me up from work today and as I walked out the door, I thought of something that I had forgot and walked back in. The kids asked Enid why I went back inside. "He must have forgot something," she explained.  
  
Ewan replied: "Laptop."  
  
I didn't know he could say that or that he was perceptive enough to notice that I had taken my work laptop with me everywhere we went all weekend.
