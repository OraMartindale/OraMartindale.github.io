Chevy was touting it's new concept car: Volt. It's a plug in car. This idea stinks! And it stinks for 2 reason:  
  
1. You're replacing your high bill at the gas pump for high bill from the electric company. Chevy (and Toyota and others considering plug-in cars) must think we're stupid. Do they really think we're not going to know or notice our electric bill went up at the same time as our gas bill went down?  
  
Now, I will grant that the increase in the electric bill will be less than the decrease  in the gasoline bill, but, I buy gas 8-12 times a month, so my bill is spread out over those 8-12 visits. My electric bill comes 1 time a month, so the increase in the electric bill isn't going to "feel" the same as if I had got a decrease at the gas pump.   
  
2. You haven't helped the environment. The main consumer of these cars are environmentally-conscious drivers. Are these drivers going to forget that the electricity for their car came from a coal-firing plant? You haven't helped the environment, or if you have, you have done a negligible job of it. You have simply replaced using 1 fossil fuel to run your car (oil) for another (coal).  
  
If they can't come up with a 100% environmentally free solution right now, then the stop-gap solution shouldn't confuse customers. I want to fill up 4-6 times a month instead of 8-12. That way I know that I'm getting a better deal and I'm not going to get surprised when my electric bill comes.
