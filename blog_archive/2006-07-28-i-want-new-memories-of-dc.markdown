The day after visiting the Library of Congress my coworkers, a coworkers husband and I went downtown again, this time at night. We exited the Metro at the Smithsonian and walked the Mall to the Washington Monument. It doesn't open late like it used to. I remember trying to cut in line long a go. Our group only had a half hour before we had to leave, so we couldn't get tickets and wait in the line that wrapped around the monument. One of our group went up to one of the National Park Services rangers to turn on the charm and see if she could get us in. Me another girl and and another guy watched from a distance.  
  
"She's turning it on," the girl said.  
  
"What?"  
  
"She's playing with her hair."  
  
"What does that mean."  
  
"When a girl is talking to you and starts playing with her hair it means she likes you." I turned to the other guy with a look that said "Do you know about this?" From the look he gave me it was obvious that I was not alone in my ignorance of female persuasive skills. I looked up at the girl and the ranger and it was obvious even from afar that she was flirting, but it didn't get us in. I wasn't too disappointed as I had seen it before.  
  
But now, years later, you could not get in this night. I was disappointed for others because I remembered the spectacular views of the Capitol, White House and Lincoln Memories from atop the Washington Monument at night.  
  
Next my coworkers and I all went to the World War 2 memorial. I must admit that I wasn't really interested in it. I had always felt that it would disturb the flow of the Mall. I don't many any disrespect to the men who fought World War 2, but I wasn't sure this was the best place for a memorial. I was plesently wrong. It is a beautiful memorial and it fits very nicely into the Mall. I was trying to relate the design to some unknown symbolism that I thought must be there, but I was never able to make the connection.  
  
I saw flowers placed beside one state's column and a picture of a warboat beside another. I was taken back again 11 years before when my group visitied the Vietnam War memorial. There is a different feeling at the two memorials. Our World War 2 veterans are dying; the memories at this memorial are often their children and grand children. Their visit is to thank them for their sacrifice. When I visited the Vietnam memorial it was obvious that our Vietnam vets are still healing. Along the wall were many more flowers and cards and letters. One small card had a note on it. We picked it up. It was a note to a fallen comrade. We turned it over. It was a business card. We walked further along the wall. There was another card of the same shape and size. We picked it up, turned it over: The same business card. A few feet later was another. We found four or five of them, all paying tribute to a fallen friend. The World War 2 memorial didn't carry the same emotion that the Vietnam memorial did, but it's a welcome addition and it's about time that World War 2 vets were recognized with their own memorial.  
  
We walked back up to the Washington monument, stopped and took pictures and I called my wife. "I wish you were here. I can't wait to show you this place."  
  
As we got back on crowded subway cars to return to our hotel, I thought about the memories I had of DC. I want new memories. It's not that the old were bad, but they don't include my wife and they don't include my son and they don't include my daughter. I thought about the new memories I wanted to make showing them all the wonders of DC. Against the dark background of the subway walls speeding by I could see my reflection. You don't think about how much you age. But as I looked at my reflection, I could see that I didn't look 18 anymore. All my memories of DC are from when I was 11(?), 18, 22. 30 now looms around the corner and I can see that in my reflection. New memories need to be made. Memories of me in a different role of husband and father and not a wide-eyed 18-year-old.
