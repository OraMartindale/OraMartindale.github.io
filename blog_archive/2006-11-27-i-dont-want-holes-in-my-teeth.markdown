Ora wasn't obeying, so I sent him to bed without our usual routine: Brushing teeth and then story. Ora screamed for 10 minutes he didn't want holes in his teeth and the dentist would have to drill and it would hurt.  
  
"What have you been telling him?" I asked Enid.  
  
"Every night I tell him that if he doesn't brush his teeth he'll  get holes in his teeth and the dentist will have to drill his teeth and it will hurt."  
  
"Oh. Well... I guess it worked."
