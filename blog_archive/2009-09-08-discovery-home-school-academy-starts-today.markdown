The kids' home school academy starts today. Once a week they go to classes at a local mega-church where they can interact with kids their own age and get some of their extra-curricular classes (spanish, PE, art, etc). Plus it gives Enid a day off.  
  
This is Aspen's first year and she will have the same kindergarten teacher that Ora 5 had. She is very excited. She picked out a Tinkerbell backpack to carry her stuff.  
  
I have the day off work today, so it is one of those rare times that I will get to drop them off and pick them up from school.
