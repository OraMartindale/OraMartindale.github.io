_This is part 8 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
We got an early start this morning. Ora and I had breakfast in the chilly morning while Enid took Aspen up to the bathhouse.  
  
Biltmore Estate  
After those preparations we headed to the Biltmore Estate. I only took one wrong turn before finding it. You enter the Biltmore Estate through a large rock arch gate. They instructed us to drive ahead and stop at the ticket office. We were directed to a building where we parked close to the entrance, but the parking lot could have held several dozen more (if not a couple hundred more) cars. We went inside and purchased tickets for Enid and myself and audio tours as well. Total price: $90.  
  
We got back into our car and drove a couple miles to the house. We wondered what it would be like to have driven into this estate 100 years ago in a horse-drawn carriage. You would get to your “driveway” and still be 3 miles from home! As we drove through there was no sign of the city of Asheville. Before entering the estate there were McDonalds, Wal-Marts, shops, businesses, but once inside the arch, the only sign we saw of civilization was Highway 40 and even it we lifted high above the forest, like bridges over the swamps of Louisiana.  
  
We finally reached the parking lot. We parked in Lot B and a sign directed us to the mansion and said “8 minutes ahead.” I would hate to have been in Lot E! We walked a mulched path (not easy with a stroller!) and the forest opened to reveal the mansion from the same view you see in all the postcards. We walked up to the top of an overlook that sat at the far end of the mansion’s front lawn and had our picture taken. They had a photo takers there who would take your picture and then give you number like you were walking into an amusement park.

Once inside Enid and I picked up our audio tour devices. I was expecting a tape player that would take you straight through the mansion and give you limited information. I was wrong. The device was a specialized digital music player that you could punch in numbers. A pamphlet showed a map of the house with numbers in each room. Each room had one number that would tell you about the room and some rooms had one to five “extras.” So you would follow the path laid out on the map,  stop in each room, punch in the number and listen. If you had time, you could punch in the other numbers and hear in-depth information about the room or music that would often be played in that room.  
  
Ora and Aspen did much better than we expected. They were actually very interested in the rooms and enjoyed listening to the audio tour as much as we did. But, after a while Ora got hungry for a morning snack and we cut our tour short. We had seen more of the mansion than we had thought the kids would allow, so we were not disappointed.  
  
We went to a snack area beside the old carriage barn and bought popcorn and $2.50 bottles of water.  
  
Next it was on to the Gardens that were a short walk from the mansion. We had seen an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition where they described how they would get pictures for the large wall hangings they would get for the houses they built. The would simply take a picture with their digital camera and send the picture to a Flickr or Ofoto service to have them enlarged. So we thought, we could do the same, and we took lots of pictures of the flower gardens.

Soon Ora and Aspen were hungry for snacks, so Ora and I headed back to the car to  get snacks and bring the car down to the gardens. As we walked back to Lot B, Ora stopped, obviously scared, and pointed to the steps ahead. Crossing the path was the first salamander we had seen on our trip. It was about six inches long, but wasn’t the red and black kind that Enid was looking for. Ora said “George Shrinks.” George Shrinks is a PBS show about a boy who is only few inches tall, but I wasn’t sure what that had to do with this salamander. When we had brought the car down and I told Enid about our discovery she explained that George Shrinks had a salamander that he rode in one episode.  
  
We had our snack and took a few more Extreme Makeover: Home Edition pictures and then headed down the road. We leisurely drove down the one-way road and decided to have lunch the Deerpark restaurant. It was a very nice lunch, but a bit fancier than our kids were used to, but it was obvious that the staff was used to small children and they even had a kids menu and coloring books for them. A couple at the next table complimented us on our children’s behavior. It is so nice to hear someone say your kids are doing well when it seems like we are trying so hard to keep them from running wild in a restaurant. Honestly, though they made a mess they did a great job.

Our next stop was a Farm Village. When the Vanderbilt’s lived on the land fulltime, this was a working village where the best farmers, shepherds, and dairy farmers, etc. were hired to provide for the needs of the Vanderbilt family. Mr. Vanderbilt wanted the estate to be self-sustaining and this is how he did it. And the family would often come down and hold competitions for who could make the best produce and jarred products. Now the Farm Village serves as part living history museum and also as a launching point for some of the Estate’s newer features: white water rafting trips and Land Rover off-road driving courses. The driving courses cost $200!  
  
We spent some time looking through the blacksmith’s shop, horse stables, etc. and then went to look at the chickens and horses. There were saw two large horses named Bert and Ernie. We petted both, but when we walked away, Bert began to kick at the door. I was worried that he was trying to get out and trample Aspen who was trying to see his feet:

Their caretaker informed us that Bert didn’t want us to stop petting him. Their caretaker then let Bert out and let Ora pet and hold his reins.

Our next stop was to the Winery. Once the dairy farm that provided milk and cheese to all of Asheville, it has now been converted into a Winery that they claim is the most visited winery in all the US.   
  
As Ora and I were taking a tour we had to stop in line. It had been a very long day (it was almost 4 by this point and we had got up early) and yet Ora had done much better than I had expected. I bent down and complimented Ora on his behavior that day. Ora instantly smiled brightly, threw his arms around me and hugged me. I think Gary Chapman would say that Ora is a words of affirmation boy with physical touch as a second love language.  
  
This wrapped up our day at the Biltmore Estate. The beginning of the audio presentation explained that in the late 20s the Vanderbilts were “gracious enough to open their home” to the public. At $45 per person and $2.50 a water bottle, and every other person buying 3 bottles of wine, I don’t think graciousness was on their minds!  
  
The kids fell asleep on the drive back to camp and then Aspen woke when we reached camp. We had a quiet evening cooking hot dogs over the fire. As we prepared to go to bed Ora woke up. We laid him down to sleep on the inflatable mattress with us because we felt a few sprinkles during dinner and we didn’t want him up against the side of the tent during rain. And the mattress deflated half way through the night.
