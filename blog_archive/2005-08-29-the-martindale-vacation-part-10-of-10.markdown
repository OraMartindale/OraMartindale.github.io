_This is part 10 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
The early hours of the morning were rather restless. The air mattress deflated again for the third time that night. Enid and I just laid listening to the sound of a caterpillar climbing the outside of the tent. Yes, if you’re quiet enough, you can hear a caterpillar climbing a tent.   
  
We began discussing what else will break: tent pole (this was from a previous camping trip), camp chair, lantern,  and air mattress. Soon the kids woke up as well and we slowly started the day. I grabbed some clothes on my way to take a shower and pulled my belt from the pants I was wearing the day before. I grabbed the belt by the buckle and it snapped and pulled apart from the leather. I walked over to Enid. “You’re not going to believe this.”  
  
After breakfast and showers Ora and I took Enid and Aspen to see the fishing pond and we spent quite a bit of time there.

When we returned it was time for lunch. Enid and I were both tired of the sandwiches that we had been having for lunch, so we decided we would go to Pizza Hut which was just down the street from the camp ground.  
  
We were sitting in Pizza Hut when I heard the TV behind me say something about maditory evacuation of the city of New Orleans. I turned around to see what was going on and learned there was a hurricane coming toward New Orleans. I realized that the hurricane would be heading north through our path home which ran back through Nashville. I watched until I was reassured that we would beat the storm home.  
  
After we got back to the campsite, Ora and I went to get quarters for laundry and stopped to play horseshoes for some time. After that we returned to the campsite for a lazy afternoon.  
  
At some point during the day, I realized that I had spent enough time with Ora and Aspen on this trip that I was beginning to learn things about them. I made a list of the things I learned about them:  


  

  * Ora can be very eloquent when I take the time to listen.
  

  * Aspen counts: "deh, eh" (one, two)
  

  * Aspen can ask for a drink: "dee"
  

  * Ora sings the alphabet and other songs while in the bathroom.
  

  * Aspen and Ora like places like the Biltmore Mansion if you explain it to them and show them exciting things to look at.
  

  * Aspen says "teekie" (stinky) when she needs her diaper changed
  
  
My son and I decided to walk to the fishing pond again. Ora was poking the water with sticks and saying it was his fishing pole. In that moment I was transported back to Wal-Mart, two days before our vacation started. I remembered how I loathed the idea of fishing and the sympathy I felt for all fathers who could not stand their sons’ interests. I thought of how selfish that was and I now wanted to fish with my son. Would he remember that he didn’t get to go fishing? Ora came over and sat on my lap.  
  
“What are you doing?” Ora asked.  
  
“I’m wondering how much of this trip you’re going to remember. Will you remember the Smokey Mountains?”  
  
“I’ll remember.”  
  
“Will you remember Mr. Vanderbilt’s house?”  
  
“I’ll remember.”  
  
“Will you remember Chimney Rock and the waterfall?”  
  
“I’ll remember.”  
  
As I sit on the pier on that little fishing pond, I’m writing these last lines. I’ll go home and type them up later and post them on my website, but the words and the end have formed in my mind. My vacation ends here at this fishing pond. There will still be the trip home and other stories I’m sure, but for me the vacation is over. My son and I get up and begin the trip back to camp. I take one last look at the little fishing pond. A fish surfaced to catch a bug. Next time my son or I will catch him.
