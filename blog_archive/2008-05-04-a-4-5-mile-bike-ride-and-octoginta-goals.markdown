We went out biking again today, this time along long north/south trail in Kansas. The trail is 14.5 miles, but we only did about 4.5 miles. Although Enid and Ora 5 could have gone longer, I gave out after pulling the trailer (with Aspen and Ewan inside) up  a small hill. It's time for me to get on a regular exercise plan!  
  
Afterwards Enid and I sat and talked. I had expressed interest in riding the [Octoginta](http://www.lawrencebicycleclub.org/octoginta/) in Ocotober as a possible preparation ride for the [Bike Across Kansas](http://www.bak.org/) in 2009. Enid asked if she could join me so we started making plans for a spring and summer filled with biking to prepare for the Octoginta.
