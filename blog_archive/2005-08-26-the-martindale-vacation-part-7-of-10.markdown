_This is part 7 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
The next day was a “down day.” There is a lot of temptation to plan too much into a vacation and end up rushing from one thing to the next with not much time to be at any one place. The advantage of this is that you see a lot of the country. I find myself trying to plan too much still. As I was planning in my head a trip to the Grand Canyon, I wanted to include the Great Sand Dunes, Four Corners, the Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion Park, Arches Park, etc. But if I tried to pack all that into a couple of weeks we would have to plan a vacation from our vacation. So the intention of a down day is to have a little time to relax and just sit.  
  
The day started with a quiet breakfast with my wife. The kids slept longer than we did and it was a nice time together.  
  
I went to the car to look for the kids’ vacation passports and I looked up and saw Aspen at the door of the tent attempting to unzip it. Enid went to go get a shower and soon Ora woke up and I made breakfast for both the kids. After a bit Aspen left the table and headed for bathhouse saying “Mommy.” I looked up the hill and saw Enid just coming into view.  
  
Our next item of business was our first attempt at hiking. We had only gone 50 feet down a path that began at our campsite when Ora said that he needed to go to the restroom; as soon as we reached the campsite he confessed that he didn’t need to go to the restroom, but was trying to avoid the hike.  
  
Our second hiking attempt began immediately; although this time Aspen decided she didn’t want to go, so Enid and she stayed behind and Ora and I continued. The campground map showed a small fishing pond and we were going to attempt to reach it. All along the trail we saw animal and human tracks. Spider webs blocked the path every few feet which gave the impression that the trails were never used and forced us to walk with a very careful eye for the shine of a line of web in the sunlight. We went down and down the hill and reached the small fishing pod. A sign declared it to be Fisherman's Wharf.

There were butterflies and dragonflies all around the pond and although I tried I could never get a good picture of the dragonflies. We stayed at the pond for quite a while.

On the way back Ora would stop suddenly and declare: “I’m stuck in the mud.” I would reach my hand out to rescue him and he would grab it and be pulled to safety. A few feet later he would declare: “Dad’s stuck in the mud” and I would reach out my hand and he would grab it and pull me to safety. Then once again Ora was stuck. I reached out my hand to him but intentionally kept it a couple of inches from his. “I can’t reach your hand.” And then with a dramatic final attempt Ora would stretch and grab my hand. This game went on the whole way back.  
  
When we got back, we had lunch and then Ora and I went to look at the campground's Yurt. If you’re not familiar with a Yurt, as I wasn’t, it’s a round tent-like structure, but very fancy. It had a beautiful and simple dark-wood bed, dresser, table, chairs and a table that ran at the foot of the bed. A small wall was at the head of the bed and hid the bathroom (I think) and there was a tinted window at the top of a conical roof. Since the roof was light brown and the sunroof was dark, Ora took to calling it the Pencil Tent. While we were there they were in the process of building the first of two new Yurts… er, Pencil Tents.  
  
We filled the afternoon coloring, playing Frisbee, playing Scrabble, reading and then we had dinner. Although this was a “down day” there are still a lot of things you must do to occupy young children’s minds.  
  
We then took a trip to Wal-Mart to get a stroller to use at the Biltmore Estate. In the parking lot Ora saw a cigarette butt lying on the ground. He pointed it out to me and then mimed the actions of a smoker pulling the cigarette to and then away from his mouth. I am amazed at the types of things that children pick up, but I'll probably never know where he saw that.  
  
We made another campfire and I began to tell Ora that the next day we were going to visit Mr. Vanderbilt’s house. I wasn’t sure how he would behave at the Mansion and I wanted to begin to prepare him. Then everyone went to bed.  
  
As I began to get the campsite ready for night I went to turn off my new Coleman lantern, which we had been using for several days. It would not turn off! I played with it for quite a while, but no matter how much I turned it down, there was still too much gas feeding into the chamber and staying lit. I thought about unscrewing the propane canister that held the gas, but when you do that it sounds like some gas is escaping and I feared it would be too much gas and cause an explosion. I disassembled the lantern housing and began attempting to turn down the lamp and blow out the flame. Finally, I was able to turn the lamp down enough and blow hard enough to extinguish the flame. I went off to bed relieved and resolved to take the lantern apart the next day and see what was wrong.
