Ora 5 was watching TV and saw an ad for Thomas the Tank Engine. He was going to be coming to a nearby city and kids could ride Thomas. Ora asked him mommy if he could go ride Thomas.  
  
"I don't know how much it would cost," Enid explained.  
  
Ora left the room and returned in a moment with money in hand. "I've got money," he declared.  
  
"WHere did you get that?"  
  
"From Aspen's room."  
  
"Did you take that out of Aspen's bank?"  
  
"Yes."
