When we were leaving Wal-Mart, where Ora 5 was denied his request to buy Tic-Tacs (he had already spent his allowance), Ora said "I need Tic-Tacs in case my girlfriend comes over." Ora has been infatuated with a couple of different girls so it was unclear who he was talking about, but I though it would be interesting to see where this went:  
  
"Why do you need Tic-Tacs if your girlfriend comes over?" I asked.  
  
"So my breath smells good."  
  
"Why do you need good smelling breath for your girlfriend?"  
  
"In case she kisses me."  
  
"Have you kissed a girl before, Ora?"  
  
"No."  
  
Then from the backseat of the van Aspen said "I'll give you a kiss, Ora."
