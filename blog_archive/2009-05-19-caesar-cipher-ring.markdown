Ora 5 wanted to make a code for just him and his friends. I assume the he got the idea from little activity sections in magazines and church kids' bulletins, but he began to create a Caesar cipher. After Ora had a little frustration in getting it just right, Enid suggested we may be able to find one online. Sure 'nough; PBS had one: [a printable Caesar cipher ring](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2615_decoding_03.html)
