I finished listening to The Iliad today. I kept waiting for the Trojan Horse to show up but it never did. Apparently that is in The Odyssey. That will be one of my next books.
  

  
It's an interesting book in that you are expecting the defeat of the city of Troy and the prophesied death of Achilles and yet it never comes. I was really looking forward to those events so it was a bit disappointing. However, at the beginning of the book an analysis of it said that the theme of The Iliad was Achilles' anger; first toward Menelaus and then toward Hector. With this theme in mind the book ends very well because the results of Achilles' two angers are wrapped up nicely.
