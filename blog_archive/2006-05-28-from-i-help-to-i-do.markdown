Aspen is now saying "I do" meaning that she wants to do it herself.  
  
She's also begun saying "It's my" when she sees a picture of herself. She means "It's me."  
  
She also ends every sentence with "Ora." It's sort of like _Being John Malchovich_: undeciferable mumbles, "Ora." More undeciferable mumbling, "Ora." Still undeciferable mumbling, "Ora."
