**Max Day 1, cont.**
  
Well we're almost done with our day-long class. Awesome stuff! B.J. and I are going to head out to the airport to pick up Bryan and Jim, which brings me to a delima. I'm currently renting a car at who knows how much money per day, but Salt Lake City has a light rail system. For $1.25 I can ride from the airport to one block from my hotel! The only time we'll need to do this is getting here and going back to the airport. So we could have spent $10 for everyone for all our travel, but we have a several hundred dollar car for a week! Plus the hotel charges for parking.
  

  
So do I take the car and return it or just keep it? I don't know if I'll have the time to return it.
