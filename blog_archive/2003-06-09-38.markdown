**Worms, Roxanne, I was afriad of worms!**
  
I was talking to a [good friend](http://www.ketnerlake.com) about the future of my blog and possibility of doing away with it. He said he wouldn't mind seeing more blogs along the lines of "Ora said his first word today and it was..." instead of longer meaningless (my word not his) blogs. So I decided that would be just what I'd blog about. Ora 5's words:
  

  
ball
  
bat
  
hat
  
hello
  
fish
  
water (we're not sure it's what he's actually trying to say, but it sounds very close)
  
puppy
  
baby
  
mama
  
daddy
  
ah ah ah achoo (He found it funny when we all had colds and now he keeps doing it)
  
wing (he's trying to say swing)
  
ouch
  
up (he says this when he actually wants to get down)
  
juice
  
stuck (as he's been on several occasions)
  
eye
  
mouth
  
apple
  
Mmm, cheese.
  
hot
  
Stop it!
  
Oh no!
  
Uh oh!
  
Whee!
  
Boo!
  
What's that?
  
What's this?
  
Who's that?
