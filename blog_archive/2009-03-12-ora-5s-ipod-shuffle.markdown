Ora 5 has been saving for a green iPod Shuffle for several weeks. So far he has saved $33. (The iPod Shuffle is $50.)  
  
Today Apple announced their new iPod Shuffle which is now $70 and has features that are not very kid friendly (back and forward controls move to the headphone cord that Ora has a tendency to chew on). So I went to Apple's site to see if I could still buy a 2nd-generation iPod Shuffle from their refurbished store. They had a silver iPod Shuffle for $30.  
  
I called Ora at home (I was at work) and explained what I had found. I asked if he would be okay getting a different color than he wanted if it meant he could pay less for it. He enthusiasticly told me yes and i bought it for him. I was very proud that he was able to sacrifice a feature he wanted (color) for a better price.  
  
Ora tells me the next thing he wants to buy is a Nintendo DS.
