Well, it's happened for a second time. A few weeks back we were shopping at Wal-Mart and Enid and I were looking at buying a pineapple cake mix. We decided not to and put the box back on the shelf. When I was checking out, I picked the same cake mix out of the cart.
  

  
_Enid must have decided to get this._ I thought.
  

  
So I placed it on the checkout counter. Later when we were unpacking groceries, Enid picked the box out of a bag.
  

  
"Oh, you decided to get this?" she inquired, displaying the box.
  

  
"No. I thought you did." Quizical expressions soon faded into realization. We both panned out heads towards Ora 5. He walked up and took the box from Enid.
  

  
The same thing happened today. This time at Target and it was baby juice. I think we're going to have to both verify the contents our grocery cart before checking out.
