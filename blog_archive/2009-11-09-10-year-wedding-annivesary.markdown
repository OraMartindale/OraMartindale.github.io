We delayed our 10-year wedding anniversary because we were busy helping with the Church Missions conference during our anniversary.  
  
We had a B&B in a small town on the Missouri river all to ourselves. Our first day we biked on the Katy Trail in the morning, came back to rest at the B&B in the afternoon and then went to Hermann. We bought some candy at a store on the main street, walked buy the shops in town and then went to the waterfront. Enid took a few pictures there:

Then we went to the Stone Hill Winery for dinner. Before dinner we took the tour; it was one of the last tours of the day, so it was just the tour guide and us. Enid took more pictures:

Finally, we went to dinner. The wait was long, but we were given a large booth and we enjoyed our meal thoroughly. Since Enid has German heritage and we were in Hermann, we both had very German meals.  
  
The next morning it was time to go home, but we stopped and got some pictures on our way out of town:

We're looking forward to the next 10 years.
