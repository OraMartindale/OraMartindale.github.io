We spent the day at Liberty Memorial. Orion, Olenna and Danny went with us as well. If you haven't been there, it is a must see in Kansas City. It is built by the same company that did the Holocaust Museum in CD and the Constitution Museum in Philly. Although it doesn't have the emotional punch that the Holocaust Museum, it doesn't fail at all. It took what I percieved to be a boring war and a footnote in history and made me want more. They were able to pack a lot of information into a small space.  
  
Olenna and Danny went up the tower, but when Orion and I tried to go up a few minutes later a storm was coming in and lightning closed it down.  
  
One of my favorite parts was touch tables where you could touch the table and interact with the displays. Think Minority Report style of interaction. The software appeared to be Flash or Director and I wondered how they were going to keep the tables working with so many people touching them until I tried one myself and realized that the tables were only white Formica and the image was being projected from above using 8 projectors.   
  
Using one of the programs, I created a propaganda poster which you could then email to yourself. I did so and after hitting send, I looked at Enid and said "What a great way to harvest my email address."
