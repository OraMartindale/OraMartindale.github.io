During the beginning of the bailout talk in Washington D.C. I sent emails to all 3 of my senators and reps asking them to vote against the $700 billion bailout plan. I used their websites in which you have to submit a form to them and select a subject from a drop-down list of topics. Of course, they all 3 voted FOR it. My two senators sent me an email explaining to me how they hated to do it, but it was necessary to keep the country from horrible things.  
  
Then today this email arrived from my rep:  


<blockquote>Dear Ora:  
  
Thank you for contacting me regarding alternative sources of energy.  I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this important issue.   
  
Increased use of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles is essential to the improvement of air quality and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our country.  These environmental improvements, as well as the goal of a decreased dependence on foreign oil have received substantial priority in recent energy policy initiatives.  In December 2007, H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act, was signed into law.  This measure is comprehensive energy legislation focused on improving energy efficiency and increasing the availability of renewable energy.  Included in the law is a target Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÃ‰) requirement of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks by model year 2020.  H.R. 6 also sets a modified renewable fuels standard, starting at 8.5 billion gallons in 2008 and rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022.  
  
Additionally, the House passed H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 on February 27, 2008, with my support.  The bill would extend and expand tax incentives for renewable electricity, energy and fuel, as well as for plug-in hybrid cars, and energy efficient homes, buildings, and appliances.  H.R. 5351 will end subsidies to Big Oil companies and invest in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency.  In H.R. 2419, the Food Conservation and Energy Act (Farm Bill), there is historic investment in affordable biofuels, which are domestically produced and renewable.  
  
America's demand for energy continues to increase as our economy and population levels grow.  In order to accommodate this demand and to control resulting pollution, the use of affordable hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels such as biodiesel, hydrogen, and ethanol should be promoted for corporations and consumers.  Congress needs to address our country's dependence on foreign oil and take steps to instill an attainable solution to America's energy problem.  I will continue to actively explore opportunities to aid the development of alternative sources of energy and look to support meaningful legislation that encourages energy efficiency and clean-fuel technology.   
  
Again, thank you for sharing your views with me.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I may be of further assistance.  Also, I encourage you to visit my website at http://www.house.gov/cleaver, where you can sign up for my electronic newsletter and receive updates on my latest activities as your Representative.  
  
Sincerely  
Emanuel Cleaver, II  
Member of Congress</blockquote>

  
Now I am wondering if his staffers just aren't reading the emails very carefully or if I selected the wrong topic from his drop-down list of approved topics to contact him about.  
  
My next email to all 3 of them will be in regard to never voting for them again. Of course, since they are all democrats that wouldn't have happened anyway.
