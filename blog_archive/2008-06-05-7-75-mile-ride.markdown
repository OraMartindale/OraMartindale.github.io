After yesterdays interrupted bike ride, we decided to go out tonight. Right now we are riding walking/biking trails and they all run next to rivers, so we wondered what the conditions of the trails would be. I heard that many of the rivers has overflown their banks and on the way home from work I saw parks that were completely flooded.  
  
We began our ride at Mission Park in Leawood and took the trail south to Tomahawk Creek Trail and rode it to the end of the trail at Nall & 124th. The trail was remarkably good, but we could see where the rivers had flown over the trail and left debris on even the tall pedestrian bridges. There was lots of mud and in a couple of places large puddles of water covered the trail.   
  
Enid and Ora 5 enjoyed splashing through them, but I had Aspen and Ewan in the trailer and tried to take muddy spots and puddles slow so that they would not be sprayed by my back tire. At first they enjoyed the water, but once the mud started they tired of it quickly. When we stopped for a break, I had to use wipes to clean both their faces and baths were required for everyone tonight.
