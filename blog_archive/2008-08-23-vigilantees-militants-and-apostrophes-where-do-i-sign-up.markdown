I saw this on CNN.com today: [Typo vigilantes banned from national parks](http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/22/sign.vandals.ap/index.html). Apparently these 2 guys went around correcting apostrophes on National Park signs. It reminded me of the book [Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss](http://www.amazon.com/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Tolerance-Punctuation/dp/1592402038/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1219498144&sr=8-1):  


<blockquote>What about telling people to shin up ladders at dead of night with an apostrophe-shaped stencil and a tin of paint? Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?</blockquote>

  
Well these 2 guys have done it! They corrected an apostrophe and a comma, but stopped short of correcting a misspelled word. But read this:  


<blockquote>They were also ordered to pay $3,035 to repair the watchtower sign.</blockquote>

  
NO! NO! NO! NO! They DID repair the sign! Some moron defaced the sign 60 years ago because they didn't have a grasp of 8th-grade English! We must join the fight against Government grammar! Join the [Typo Eradication Advancement League](http://www.jeffdeck.com/teal/) today!
