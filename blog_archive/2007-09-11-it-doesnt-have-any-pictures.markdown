I decided to read the "Little House" series of books to Aspen. She is about the age Ora was when I began reading him the Chronicles of Narnia. As I began she looked at the book and said "It doesn't have any pictures." I explained that you had to imagine what was being said in her mind. She looked at me incredulously.  
  
I began reading, but was interrupted and had to leave the room. When I came back, Aspen had flipped forward several pages to a page that had a picture. "Read here," she instructed.  
  
"We'll get there, but we have to start back here," I said flipping back.   
  
I continued reading and we soon came to a part about wolves howling outside their house only feet from the front door. Pa woke Laura and showed her the wolves outside the window. "I want to see the wolves," Aspen interrupted.  
  
"You have to imagine the wolves in your mind," I explained. She gave me the same look as earlier.  
  
We continued to read and soon came to a part about a bear that tried to eat the family hog. "I want to see the bear," Aspen said.  
  
"There's no picture of the bear," I said patiently. "You have to image the bear in your mind."  
  
"Maybe there's a picture of the bear later."  
  
"I don't think so," I said doubtfully.  
  
We continued reading and the situation repeated 1 or 2 more times although I do not remember what she wanted to see in those cases. We finished the chapter and as I turned the page to the next chapter, a picture of a bear sat alongside chapter 2's title.   
  
"See," Aspen said as she pointed to the bear.
