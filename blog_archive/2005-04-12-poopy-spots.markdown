Enid called me at work today to tell me that Ora 5 had received a coloring page in the mail from a radio station. If he colored it and sent it in, he could win a prize. So she gave it to him to start coloring. He drew blues and reds and yellows on the fish in the picture. Then he picked up the brown crayon and began drawing brown circles on the under sides of the first.  
  
"What are those?" Enid asked.  
  
"Those are his poopy spots."
