[![World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1165766703m/8908.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z_An_Oral_History_of_the_Zombie_War?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_review) [World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z_An_Oral_History_of_the_Zombie_War?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_review) by [Max Brooks](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5791.Max_Brooks)  
  
rating: 4 of 5 stars  
The zombie genre gets a new look with this book. I listened to the abridged audio book (couldn't find unabridged at my library). It's done in an interview style 10 years after the zombie war so it feels like you're listening to a History Channel documentary.  
  
Max Brooks (son of movie comedian Mel Brooks) has done such a wonderful job thinking through all the consequences of a worldwide zombie virus that all the characters and events seem plausible. Through interviews with doctors, intelligence operatives, government leaders, war lords, veterans, mercenaries, neighborhood watch leaders, etc, he creates a war so believable that I had to remind myself: "This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real."
