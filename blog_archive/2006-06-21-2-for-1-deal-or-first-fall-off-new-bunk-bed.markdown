The kids had the first fall off the new bunk bed. I had left the room only moments before when I heard a crash. I ran back to find both kids screaming on the floor. After checking both for broken bones, Enid and I comforted them until they were able to calm down.  
  
Ora related the story: Aspen was on the top bunk and Ora was climbing up to it when he began to fall back. Trying to grab something to hold onto, he had grabbed Aspen and she followed him down.
