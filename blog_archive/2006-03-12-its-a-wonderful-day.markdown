It was an unusually warm day for early March, so we packed up the kids and a picnic lunch and went to Loose Park. Apparently everyone else had the same idea because there were lots of people there and finding a parking space required a drive around the entire park.  
  
When we got out our picnic lunch we realized we had forgotten a blanket, so we had a nice picnic on a bench.  
  
We then went to feed the ducks (we had brought half a loaf of bread. Apparently everyone else had that idea as well, because the pond was filled with uneaten pieces of bread and they weren't clamouring for food like they usually are.
