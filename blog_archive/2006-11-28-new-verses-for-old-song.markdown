Tonight on the way to Wal-Mart Ora was singing a familiar song:  


<blockquote>Oh be careful little eyes what you see.  
Oh be careful little eyes what you see.  
For the Father up above is looking down in love,  
So be careful little eyes what you see.  
</blockquote>

He then began to add his own verses:  


<blockquote>Oh be careful little nose what you smell.  
Oh be careful little nose what you smell.  
For the Father up above is looking down in love,  
So be careful little nose what you smell.  
  
Oh be careful little skeleton how you move.  
Oh be careful little skeleton how you move.  
For the Father up above is looking down in love,  
So be careful little skeleton how you move.  
  
Oh be careful little brain what you think.  
Oh be careful little brain what you think.  
For the Father up above is looking down in love,  
So be careful little brain what you think.  
</blockquote>
