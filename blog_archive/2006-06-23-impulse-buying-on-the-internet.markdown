I was looking at buying Adobe Photoshop Elements for my wife to do scrapbooking. It's $80 which is better than I expected, but then I saw a little feature on Adobe's site: the "Before you choose, consider getting" feature. In this case it recommended that I look at Adobe Photoshop before choosing Photoshop Elements. So I clicked the link, but it said "Before you choose, get Photoshop as part of Adobe Creative Suite Standard." Clicking on that brought a recommendation of Adobe Creative Suite Premium, then Adobe Design Bundle, and finally Adobe Web Bundle for the low, low price of $1,899!  
  
It's like impulse buying for the Internet.
