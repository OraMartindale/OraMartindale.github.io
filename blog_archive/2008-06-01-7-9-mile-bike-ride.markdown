We went for a 7.9-Mile bike ride this afternoon. We started on the Missouri side of Indian Creek Trail which currently ends at Holmes & 99th. (They'll be extending it in the future.) We rode it past State Line and into Leawood Park. From there we rode it south until it connected with Tomahawk Creek Trail and rode south on that trail for about a mile.  
  
When we stopped for a break, it was at a small pond. Ora found a large frog and then noticed that dozens of tiny frogs were all around. He picked up one and brought it to us. It was small enough that its whole body could have fit on a dime. Aspen was unafraid to pick them up either.  
  
We rode back and completed almost 8 miles with no chain problems on Ora's bike.
