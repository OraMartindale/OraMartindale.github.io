Soon after I arrived home, I saw my neighbor pull up to the front of her house. She got out and proceeded to shovel her drive to try to get into her garage. (At my part of the street, you drive UP your driveway.) I got my shovel and offered Ora 5 $1 to help me and out we went to help shovel. It was short work with three people and she made it up her drive.

After being in for about 1/2 hour, I saw another neighbor shoveling her drive. From seeing her husband arrive home, I knew that she would pull her car down the driveway, he would pull his Mustang in the garage and then she would repark in the driveway. I grabbed my shovel again, offered Ora and additional $1 and out we went. It was short work again.

Probably a 1/2 hour later my neighbor knocked on my door. Her husband's Mustang was stuck at the bottom of the street. I ran down with my shovel and we cleared Â short path for his wheels and tried pushing, but it didn't work. As soon as it hit more snow, it was stuck again. We ended up shoveling a path for each tire all the way up the street to his house! He's in his garage now.
