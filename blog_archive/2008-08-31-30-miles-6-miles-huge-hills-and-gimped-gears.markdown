Enid and I took our 30-mile ride today. We started out of Havensville on monster hills. They almost killed us in the first 3 miles and I discovered that my gears aren't working right: They're bent. When in my top gear my derailleurs are hitting the spokes. I suspect they got bent up when I took my fall on our 20-mile ride. We continued on over many more hills and made it our 30 miles, so we're satisfied by very tired.  
  
While we were on our ride, Oma took Ora 5 and rode from Havensville to Onaga. A 6-mile ride on-road. We haven't taken Ora on-road because he weaves so much on the trails that we have been afraid he will weave into a passing car. Oma said that he was very steady on his bike and when she would tell him "car back" he would move right over and stay on the white line of the road. Oma tells us that he also rode up every hill which is impressive because he is on a mountain bike and there are a couple of monster hills on that route, too. We're very proud of him!
