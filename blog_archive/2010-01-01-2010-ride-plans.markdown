After reading Cousin Brad's plans for 2010 road and MTB rides as well as runs, I decided to put our own biking plans down "on paper." Last year, we had planned on doing an organized ride every other month, but didn't do it. We realized that if we don't put it down on paper, it's not going to happen. So here's our 2010 ride list:  
  
  
**April**  
[Cabin Fever Challenge ](http://www.wam-sag-man.org/cabinfeverchallenge.php)(April 17)  
  
**June**  
[Amelia Earhart Ride](http://www.kansascyclist.com/events/AmeliaEarhartCentury.html) (June 27)  
  
**July**  
[Lenexa Midnight Bike Ride](http://midnightbikeride.org/) if it's not in Shawnee Mission Park (July 10)  
  
**August**  
[Cider Mill Century](http://www.kansascyclist.com/events/CiderMillCentury.html) (no, we won't do a century; August 3)
