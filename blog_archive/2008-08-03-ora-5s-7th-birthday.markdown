We celebrated Ora 5's birthday today with a Wall-E party. I had asked him if he wanted to have a Wall-E birthday or an Indiana Jones birthday, those being this summers kiddie [memes](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=meme). He thought about it for a moment and said "Let's do Wall-E this year and we can do Indiana Jones for my 8th birthday." So Wall-E it was:

We bought him biking shorts, gloves and a jersey:

The jersey has a preying mantis riding a bike.
