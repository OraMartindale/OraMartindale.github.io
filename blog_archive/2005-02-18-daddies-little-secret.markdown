Since our daughter is sick she hasn't been sleeping well. Mom walks her around and tries to get her to go to sleep. Last night I heard those three words every man dreads: "It's your turn."  
  
I have to confess that early in our parenting experience I was a jerk in this area. I figured that I was the one who went to work so I need my sleep. It's only taken a couple of times with the kids sans mom to realize that she has a harder job than I do! So it's not fair for her to do the work of loosing sleep.  
  
But I still dreaded staying up 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour (!) walking a screaming kid to sleep. And then I discovered that I could walk the kid to sleep, but didn't have to listen. Dads, get yourself a tape deck, a portable CD player, an iPod and put it on. Listen to the Wall Street Journal from Audible.com, the latest Clancy novel or self-help book from the library, or your free iTunes song (thanks Pepsi!).   
  
Now, it doesn't matter to me if it takes an hour to get a kid to sleep, because I'm listening to something while I do it. Every dad should tune in to this idea.
