Today was an arts day. Olenna, Eden and Orion joined us and we started our day at the Kemper Museum of Modern Art. Modern art is always love it or hate it for me, but one piece amazed me. It was a simple mobile that hung over a white background. It was black and it had a square a circle and a triangle hanging from it. The triangle wasn't solid though, it was actually many small parallel bars that together shaped a triangle. I wondered how the parallel bars seemed to hang in space, so I got closer. I realized that the mobile was not hanging at all. The entire piece of art was flat and you could tell that if you looked at it from the site; however, as you walked in front of it, the background seemed to fall away from the mobile as if the background where curved. I walked back and forth and could not figure out how it was done, but it was amazing. I neglected to get the artists name, but it was my favorite piece in the gallery.  
  
Next we went the Nelson and spent several hours there. We first toured the old part, then had lunch and then toured the new part. Although, I'm no architecture critic, I like the new part much more than I thought I would.   
  
They also have free audio tours which I would recommend to anyone. It gives you a much better appreciation of the art. One piece of art depicted an old-time politician campaigning for votes. I've always liked it, but the audio tour taught me that it was painted by a former politician and represents his distaste for it. Pick up one of the audio tours when you go next time.
