Aspen and I were playing on the floor again and she crawled to me before falling. I had her try again and mom came in to watch and she crawled 3 feet.
  

  
A little later she was reaching for something on the floor and I told her to "Get it" and I thought she repeated me. I said "Get it" again and once again she repeated me. A third try resulted in the same thing. Enid heard it as well and I declared it her third word. Enid then told me that she's also been saying Ora in response to her brother. So "Ora" is her third word and "Get" is her fourth.
  

  
She also said "Dadda" and "Momma" in the same conversation. I think the words are going to start coming fast now.
