**The Abortion of the Democratic Party**
  
Peggy Noonan writes a moving [opinion article](http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110002936) on abortion's long-term affect on the Democratic Party.
  


<blockquote>No party can long endure, or could possibly flourish, with the unfettered killing of young humans as the thing that holds it together. And so a prediction on this grim anniversary: Someday years from now we will see abortion's final victim, and it will turn out to be the once-great Democratic Party, which was left at the end deformed, bloody and desperately trying to kick away from death, but unable to save itself.</blockquote>
