I finished the book "Over the Edge of the World" today. It is about the circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan's expedition. Although only 18 of the 260 men made it back to Spain and only one of the five ships, the expedition made a profit and caused King Charles to sent three more expeditions with the goal of controlling the global economy which was within their reach. But all three follow-up expeditions failed. Due to King Charles' debt as he tried to buy a privileged Catholic post and the cost of the three failed expeditions, he was nearly bankrupt and could not capitalize on the discoveries Magellan made to control the global economy.  
  
I guess debt was bad even 500 years ago.
