**"Note to self..."**
  
Kevin began [musing](http://www.ketnerlake.com) this week about how to keep ideas of which he's thought. He starts with the usual ideas of pen and paper beside the bed, but moves on to a more interesting one of using his iPaq's audio recording feature to record ideas as he comes up with them. But, he feels that this medium won't work for some reason and can't quite place why he feels like that. Let me help you Kevin.
  

  
Do you remember when Norm McDonald hosted SNL's news broadcasts? His classic shtick is that he'd stop, pull out his tape recorder and say "Note to self..." and then list some outrageous thing that he should do. He did the same thing in the movie Dirty Work. I can just image Kevin stopping, pulling out his iPaq and "Note to self..."
