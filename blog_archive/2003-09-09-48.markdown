**The 1,000th pic**
  
In less than a year's time we have taken 1,000 pictures with our digital camera. Enid's parents bought the camera for her birthday last year. I have to admit I wasn't real enthusiastic about it at first. I didn't see the need for a digital camera.  Boy was I wrong! We have been thrilled with our digital camera. If someone were contemplating buying their first digital camera or staying with an film camera, I've thought of some of the reasons why I love having our digital camera.
  

  
_Development costs._ We take a lot more pictures than we ever would have, because we don't have to worry about development costs. To have taken 1,000 pictures with my APS camera would have cost around $280 in development costs. If you looked at it from a pure numbers standpoint and ignore that you wouldn't take as many pictures with a film camera as you would a digital, a decent Kodak camera can pay for itself in a year.
  

  
_Perfect pictures every time._ We also love it because we can instantly see how our pictures have turned out. I've never been very good at setting up a shot and making sure the light is right or I'm standing in the right spot for a shot. I've had a passing interest in learning more about photography, but know that I would never dedicate the time, patience or study that it would require. With the digital I can take a picture, look at it, decide if I like it or not and then try again if I need to do so. Sometimes I'll take 10 pictures to get one I like. I never would have done that with a standard camera.
  

  
_No more scanning! _Now I can import the photos straight to my iBook and email them to family, quickly have them online or edit them into a film with iMovie and it's cool "Ken Burns" effects. It reminded of when I first wanted to scan in photos and I went to James' house and scanned in photos using a hand-held scanner that you had to hold precisely steady as you pulled it over the pictures. Thank goodness those days are gone.
  

  
_The pics I never took._ It also allows me to take pictures of things that I never would have. I most likely wouldn't have taken those pictures of the river-front park because of the cost involved for so little a return and the time it would take to scan all of them and display them here.
  

  
_I only have the pictures I want._ Usually when I'd get my pack of photos back from developing, there would only be one or two that you would really want to put in a photo album or on the wall. The rest would just sit at the bottom of the closet and rarely be looked at again. And that brings up...
  

  
_Storage._ Storage has been greatly reduced. Instead of 40 envelops of pictures sitting at the bottom of my closet, I can put all these photos on a couple of CDs.
  

  
_Setbacks and Backups_ The one thing to keep in mind when you get a digital camera is that your pictures are more susptible to loss. If you have all your pictures in the bottom of the closet, they are most likely not to disappear unless a natural disaster occurs (flood, fire, tornado). If all you pictures are on your hard drive, a lot more can go wrong. Your hard drive can fail, you may accidently delete a directory that contained the pictures, your 2-year old could manage to hit the delete key while pounding on your keyboard. In our case, it was theft. Our house was broken into and both the laptop and the camera were stolen. With it went almost 200 picures of our first family vacation and any pictures of 5 before 9-months of age. My good friend Jason commented, "Why is it those of us in the IT industry who know we should backup don't often do it?"
  

  
There are a couple of ways that we are now backing up our photos. The first is to copy all of the photos onto a CD; however, if you don't have a program automatically doing this for you or are not incredibly disciplined, it's rare that you'll actually do this. This tends to be my problem. The second way is an online photo service. I use Ofoto. Although I CAN NOT recommend them for their film services, their digital photo services are wonderful. They are a Kodak company and closely associated with Apple. (When you buy photos from Apple's iPhoto program, they are done by Ofoto and carry both companies branding.) Every time I import photos into iPhoto, I also upload them to Ofoto. Ofoto also has a service that allows you to make CDs of the albums you have created online, so if I ever lost my computer again and didn't have backups at home, I can simply order them from Ofoto.
  

  
So without further ado, the 1,000th pic:

Somewhat anticlimactic isn't it?
