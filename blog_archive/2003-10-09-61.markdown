**First Kicks**
  
While watching Smallville this evening, my wife reached over for my hand and placed it on her belly. She's been doing this routinely over the last couple of weeks while I feel nothing, so I didn't really expect much.
  

  
Then suddenly a kick. Then another. And another. For the next few minutes the newest member of the family strongly kicked my hand. The kicks were so strong that had I not been feeling Enid's belly for the past weeks for some kick, I would have believed that I would have felt kicks previously: Soft kicks at first starting a couple of weeks ago. Then a few days later, "Woa, that was a strong one." Then earlier this week, "She or he's getting better at kicking." Then today's kicks would have arrived as expected. But that's not how it went. (S)he just started kicking away as strong as could be tonight.
