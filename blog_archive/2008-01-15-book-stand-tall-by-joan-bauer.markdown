This book is a young readers book. I listen to them occasionally because it's nice to listen to a simpler book once and a while and I am always looking for chapter books that I might read to Ora 5.  
  
The book deals with a 7th grader nicknamed "Tree" dealing with his parents divorce. His grandfather tells him that you have to take something apart in order to understand how it works. His grandfather "takes apart" the Vietnam War, in which he was a veteran, to understand how it works. Tree "takes apart" his parents divorce to understand how it works.
