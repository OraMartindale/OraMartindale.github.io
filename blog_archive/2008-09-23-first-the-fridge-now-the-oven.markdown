Enid was cooking a meal tonight, but when she opened the oven, the temperature which had reached 400° when she put the meat loaf in had fallen to 150°. I tried several things, but the oven isn't working. I tried the broiler and it is working, so I took apart the bottom of the oven. The heating element wouldn't come on and there was no gas coming out. So, I called my father-in-law. I gave him the make and model and he said he would do some research.  
  
The worst part is that I leave tomorrow for New York and so I can't fix it (or buy a new one) until I get back Friday.
