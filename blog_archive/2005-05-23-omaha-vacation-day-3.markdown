Then next morning Enid and I slept in. We finally got up and prepared breakfast. But the kids didn't get up. We decided that rather than rush them into clothes and rush off to church, we would let them sleep in after their long day at the Zoo. They slept for what seemed like forever.  
  
Aspen awoke first. In the last couple of days she had been amazed at the birds. They would fly within 10 feet of you, land, and then hop around until the found a worm. Then they would pull it from the ground and have breakfast. She found this fascinating.  
  
It was nice to slow down, not have a computer, or a TV, or work or anything else. We could simply watch the birds eat. I marveled that God had built birds to be able to detect a worm in the ground without any difficulty. A bird would find a work, pull it out, eat it, take two hops and then do it again. I sat simply amazed with my daughter at the creation before me.  
  
When Ora 5 finally woke up and ate, we packed up and then headed out. It was a long drive back to KC. We stopped at the first rest stop in Missouri and had lunch. On the way we discussed what went right and what went wrong and made plans four North Carolina in August.
