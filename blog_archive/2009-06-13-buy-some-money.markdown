Aspen was quite insistent that we eat at a restaurant today. After Enid's purchase of a new camera, I had declared a no-spending weekend, so I explained "we can't go out to eat today; we don't have any money."  
  
"Then go buy some," she insisted (loudly).  
  
"Buy some money?"  
  
"At the bank!" She then pointed a finger emphatically at the car and declared "Go!"
