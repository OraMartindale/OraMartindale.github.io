We finally saw Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. We caught a 10PM show at Belton. We were the only ones in the theatre. Aspen saw the opening scrawl and excitedly pointed up at it. Then she fell asleep.  
  
I have to say "Wow!" It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I still have a couple of lingering questions, but almost everything was perfect. The beginning was fun. Anakin's struggles and turn to the dark side felt real. It tied up loose ends from the first 2 movies and helped the last 2 movies make more sense. I was knocked off my socks and gasped audibly when Vader used his long-distance choking technique for the first time!  
  
There's so many great things about this movie, I could go on forever, but I'll leave it at that.
