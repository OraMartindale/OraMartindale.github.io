**Hitler didn't have The Bomb**
  
[An interesting BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/3127222.stm) highlights how far behind the U.S.A., German scientists were from creating an A-bomb:
  


<blockquote>Certainly when the Americans captured the German's nuclear research papers they found that the project was at least three years behind the Allies. 
  

  
They had not even produced the first stage of the atomic programme, a small crude nuclear reactor - built in the US in 1942. </blockquote>
