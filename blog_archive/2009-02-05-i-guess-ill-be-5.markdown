Today is Aspen's 5th birthday. Boy the years have gone quick. But she doesn't believe it is her birthday because we are not having her party until Saturday, when family can be here. "I'm still 4!" she's says with a bit of attitude.  
  
"So, I guess I can still give you $4 for your allowance?" I asked. (Her allowance is based on her age.) She thought about that for a moment and responded:  
  
"I guess I'll be 5."
