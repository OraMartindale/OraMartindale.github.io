I've looked around for quite a while for 1-inch white hexagonal tiles. You see them occasionally in advertisements or movies or even the entryway to a shop on an old courthouse square. However, finding them to purchase was much harder. I did a lot a looking around at tile places, but couldn't find it. I did searches on the Internet, but never found it, but I have found a lot of other people also looking for it. I finally found it at Lowe's. This post is mostly for those people trying to find it. Here's the details:  
  
Store: Lowe's  
Manufacturer: [American Olean](http://www.americanolean.com/)  
Product Code: 0D261HEXMS1P (This may be Lowe's code and not the manufacturer's)
