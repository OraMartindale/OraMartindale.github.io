Last night I finally got a chance to test using Skype to call missionaries from the church. It worked really well and I recommend it for any church that is considering a good way to talk to their missionaries.  
  
Here's what I did:

  

  1. ### [Get Skype](http://www.skype.com)

I downloaded Skype and installed it on the church computer and signed up for an account.  

  

  2. ### Audio Out

Audio out is a bit of a struggle since there is a 1/8-inch-size headphone jack on a laptop and I need to get it into an XLR jack on the church audio board. I started by hooking up a 1/8-1/4 adapter to the laptop's headphone jack.  
  
From there I attach a 1/4-inch cable. To get to the XLR size cable I hook the 1/4-inch cable into a "hot box." (A smaller version of [this](http://www.remoteaudio.com/hotbox/).) On one side the 1/4-inch cable hooks in and on the other an XLR cable.  
  
Then from the hot box, the XLR cable hooks into one of the channel on the audio board.  

  

  3. ### Audio In

Eventually I will need to get audio from the sound board back to the laptop because we want Pastor, who will be at the front of the church with a mic, to be speaking directly to the missionary. But for the test today, I hooked up a cheap little mic with a 1/4-inch male connector, once again using a 1/8/1-4 adapter into the laptop's mic jack. Thankfully they are spaced enough apart that both adapters fit next to each other.  

  

  4. ### Start Skype

I then logged into Skype and moved it onto the church's projector screen. Our setup treats the projected screen as a second monitor to the left of the laptop, so anything I drag off the right side of the laptop monitor (including Skype) shows up on the projector screen.  

  

  5. ### Test Sound

Skype has a nice test account that you can dial to test your Skype connection. To test that sound I simply made a call to the test account. It asks you to record your message after the beep. This spoken part came over the church speakers loud and clear. I then spoke into the mic after the beep and after a few seconds Skype replayed my voice and that came over the church speakers nicely, so I knew the mic was working.  

  

  6. ### Test Video

I had prearranged a Skype call with one of our missionaries, so I called him and he enabled his web cam. In Skype you can make the video full screen, so I did so and it filled the entire projector screen. As a nice surprise, the video controls disappear if you leave the mouse alone for a few seconds.  

  
  
Everything went great and was easy to setup. There are three things that I would like to do next; two are must does and the other would be nice but not necessary:  


  

  * First I would be to figure out how to cable everything up without the use of the hot box. The hot box is used by one of our guitarists and I feel it is too much setup anyway. I would like to get a [cable that is 1/4-inch to XLR](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/308978-REG/Remote_Audio_CALEC100XLP_XLR_Male_to_1_8_.html).
  

  * Second, I need to get audio from Pastor's mic to the laptop. This can probably be accomplished by taking the audio out from the "house" line that everyone hears into the laptop. I think that may on require using a [cable that is 1/4-inch to 1/8-inch](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/599558-REG/Line_6_98_032_0007_XC2_1_4_Premium_Phone.html), but I need to talk to our audio guy to figure that out.  

  

  * Lastly, I would like to setup a web cam at the church so that the missionaries can see Pastor as they speak to him. There's a couple of ways that I can think of handling this. One would be a [wireless camera](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001764PVQ/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000067JZF&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0697XD16NE0J4WA1WC7P), but I need to do some research on how that works. The other would be to take a standard camcorder (with zoom) and hook it up to the laptop and zoom in on the Pastor.
