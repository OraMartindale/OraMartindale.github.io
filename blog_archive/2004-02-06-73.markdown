**Snow**
  
What every parent fears will happen the day they go into labor happened the day after: 8 inches of snow. Ora 5, Oma and I drove through carless why highways to the hospital to spend the day with Enid and Aspen.
  

  
It didn't stop snowing through the day and was probably the most snow we got all winter. We watched it piling up on the roof outside Enid's hospital window.
