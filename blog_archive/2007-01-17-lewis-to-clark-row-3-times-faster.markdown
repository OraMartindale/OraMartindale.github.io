I was listening to an audio book of _To America_ by Stephen Ambrose. He says that due to the work of the Corp of Engineers, the Missouri River flows 3 times faster than it did when Lewis and Clark explored it 200 years ago.  
  
I've spent time in Parkville along the river and saw the Lewis & Clark keel boat come through in 2004 for the memorial and wondered at how much work it would take to row upriver. It makes sense now that I know the river flows faster.  
  
I even spoke to a representative from the Corp of Engineers about lawsuits that had been filed on behalf of returning to the river to its natural state. He laughed off the idea.
