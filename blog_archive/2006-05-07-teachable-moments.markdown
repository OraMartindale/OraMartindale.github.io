On the way to visit Enid's parents we pass Fort Riley. When Ora asked me where we were I saw the opportunity to teach him some of our Kansas history:  
  
Ora 4: "We're at Fort Riley. This is a famous base. J.E.B Stuart trained here before the Civil War. Custard worked here before he was defeated by an Indian tribe. George Patton trained here before World War 2. And the Big Red 1, a famous force during World War 2, was from here."  
  
Ora 5: "I have hiccups."
