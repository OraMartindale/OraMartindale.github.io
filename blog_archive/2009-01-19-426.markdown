### My review

](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/22584653?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_review)I listened to this audio book and didn't know how worthwhile a book about how to visit a civil war battlefield would be. I was pleasantly surprised.  
  
The book is more history book as it covers 10 significant battles, why they were important and then a bit of what to see at each site. The battles are listed in chronological order, so you also are led through the war in a logical progression.  
  
I can imagine borrowing the physical book to plan a future vacation.
