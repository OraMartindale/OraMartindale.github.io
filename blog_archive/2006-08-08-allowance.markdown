On the way to Wal-Mart, my son asked for his allowance.  
  
"I have your allowance, Ora."  
  
"Allow-i," Aspen, who is still 18 months away from getting an allowance, said.  
  
We arrived at Wal-Mart and I pulled out my wallet. The process is the same every time:  
  
"How old are you," I ask Ora.  
  
"Four." I pull four 1-dollar bills out of my pocket. And Ora counts them out as I hand them to him. "One. Two. Three. Four."  
  
"Where does the first dollar go?" I ask.  
  
"Uh... Church?" he says, not overly confident.  
  
"Yes. Where does the second dollar go?"  
  
"Bank," with slightly more authority.  
  
"And the last two are for you to spend." As my wallet emerged this time, Ora's hand shot up, all fingers extended.  
  
"I'm five!"  
  
Our eyes met. Realization spread across my face and a smile spread accross his. I was a dollar short.
