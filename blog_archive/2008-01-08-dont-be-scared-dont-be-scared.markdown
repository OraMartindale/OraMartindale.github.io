Ora 5 went to his first day at [Discovery Homeschool Academy](http://www.firstbaptistraytown.com/schools/discovery/default.htm), a one-day-a-week school day for homeschool kids. Ora had gotten a new backpack and took his lunch for his "first day of school." As he walked in the door Enid says that he was saying to himself "Don't be scared. Don't be scared."  
  
He had a great day liked his teacher, made some new friends and decided he wanted to eat the school lunches instead of bringing his lunch.  
  
His only disappointment was "we did letter L today. Next week we are doing letter M. I know them already."
