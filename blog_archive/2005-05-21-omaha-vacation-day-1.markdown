It is our intention to go to Asheville, NC in August. We will be camping, so in preparation we decided to take a weekend camping trip to Omaha to test the waters. It would be test as to how well Enid and I could camp as a couple as it was our first camping trip together; how well the kids would do camping; what types of supplies we had and what we still needed; and what things had we not thought about that would pop up.  
  
We began packing the car we soon realized that we could not fit everything into the back of our Oldsmobile Alero. With a little creative packing and forceful shoving we got everything into the back except pillows and sleeping bags which were shoved into the floors of the back seats (their legs don't reach far enough down for it to bother them). Pillows were put in between the two kids. Lesson learned: We'll need a car-top carrier.  
  
We rolled out of KC and headed to Omaha. We drove up I-29, through Council Bluffs and into Omaha. Then headed out of town again to our KOA. I haven't been in a KOA in about 15 years, but I was impressed. I remember KOAs as looking like they had been built in the 50s and deteriorating ever since. This one was nice! Everything was clean, the had  a big playground, they had DVDs to rent in the office and the bathrooms were spotless. They even had wireless internet access. This was a different KOA than I remembered!  
  
We set up our tent and cooked our dinner and then had smores. Ora 5 was excited to sleep in a tent for the first time and his enthusiasm infected Aspen as well. We had a wonderful night's sleep.
