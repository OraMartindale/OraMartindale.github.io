Scaled Composites will make their first attempt today to enter space on a privately-created spacecraft and repeat the journey with the same craft in two weeks: the goal of the Ansari X-Prize. The X-Prize is attempting to spur space tourism and it looks like it's working:
  

  


<blockquote>Virgin Atlantic Airways founder Richard Branson on Monday announced that he will license the technology behind SpaceShipOne to build a fleet of five-seat spacecraft to offer $190,000 rides to space tourists beginning in 2007.
  

  
Another space entrepreneur, hotelier Robert Bigelow, has also announced plans to build private space stations that can be used as platforms for industrial research or as tourist destinations.

I look forward to taking the kids into space someday, but it may be with my grandkids as well. Enid can't go scuba diving because of her lung surgery so I'm guessing she won't be able to go into space, but I don't think she has any desire to do so.
