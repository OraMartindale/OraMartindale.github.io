**MAX Day 1**
  
I'm sitting in my day long class on the first day of Macromedia MAX. It's a great class so far.
  

  
It's hard to be away from my family for the whole week, but I'm looking forward to all I'm going to learn.
  

  
Jason's surgery began this morning so I'm praying that he's out by now and all went well.
  

  
In other news: Bungee jumping Thursday night!
