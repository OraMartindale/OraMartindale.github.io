**The Decade of the River**
  
As a follow up to my writing about the Riverfront park, I found [an article in the Kansas City Star](http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascitystar/news/local/6785865.htm) detailing all the plans.
  

  
There was also a link to the [Riverfront's official site](http://www.kcriverfronttrail.org/). The bridge that my family and I were on is called the "Town of Kansas Pedestrian Bridge" and is  the site of the original landing and establishment of the town of Kansas.
