I wan't convinced that the iPod Shuffle would be a big seller; it has none of the features that I love about the iPod. However, a coworker who I never thought would by an Apple product bought one.  
  
Then today Rick and I went to Best Buy and Rick bought himself one. Like all Apple products, you really don't know how great the product is until you hold it in your hands. And this is an awesome product. It feels great. It looks great. Apple proves even the fan-critics wrong.
