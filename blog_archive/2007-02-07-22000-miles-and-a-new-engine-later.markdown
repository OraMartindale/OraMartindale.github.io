My oil light came on this morning. I called the dealer and they towed it and called me later telling me a seal had broken and my oil leaked out. Since I had just been in Friday to get my oil changed I thought they had forgotten to put oil in it.  
  
"Wouldn't I have seen oil in my driveway?" I asked. I was told that the seal could have broken between home and work in which case I would not have.  
  
Long story made less long, Chrystler wanted the dealer to put a new engine in rather than just replacing the seal! That made me a little more comfortable: if they had forgot to put oil in, I would be worried about damage to the engine. If they're going to spend their $7,000 for a new engine and I get a non-damaged engine, I'm happy.  
  
Tonight I drove home in a Pacific (paid for by the dealer) only to find a large oil spill on my driveway.
