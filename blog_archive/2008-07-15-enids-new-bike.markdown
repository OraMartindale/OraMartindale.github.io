Enid found a bike on Craigslist! The owner was a KC cop who is occasionally on the bike  patrol. He had a shirt on that said "God made cops so fire fighters would have heroes." I thought that was funny.  
  
When Enid knocked on his apartment door, he answered and brought the bike out for her to try. When he opened the door, Enid could see his gun and holster hanging from the dining room chair. I wondered if that's where he normally hung his gun or if that was a way of telling strange people who contact him through Craigslist "Don't mess with me."  
  
He bought his wife a bike, but she didn't enjoy it, so the bike is barely ridden. We bought it and here she is on it:

Now the bike needs a name.
