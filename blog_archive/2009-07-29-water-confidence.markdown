Last week I put a swim belt on Ewan for the first time and he began to swim all over. He loved it. Well he must of gotten too confident because Saturday we were in a pool that didn't have swim belts (in his size) and while playing at a pool ladder decided to let go. He tried his hardest to tread water but the only part of his body above water was the top of his head.  
  
So, today when we returned to the Y and I put a swim belt on him, he held on to the side pretty tight. I encouraged him to let go and swim a bit. At first he did it timidly, but upon finding that he was staying above water, he proceeded to swim on his own for 2 hours.
