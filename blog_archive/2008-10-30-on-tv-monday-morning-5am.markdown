I know nobody will get up that early to see me, but set your DVRs for the 5am broadcast on NBC and rebroadcast throughout the morning. They came into my office and did the interviews this morning and they will be playing it sometime during the morning news on Monday, 11/3/08.  
  
If you miss it there or from out of town, you should be able to catch in on [http://www.nbcactionnews.com](http://www.nbcactionnews.com).
