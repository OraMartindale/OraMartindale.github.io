I've heard of kids picking up phrases from their parents that we wish they hadn't. I heard of one woman who would tell her girl "I refuse to negotiate with a 4-year old" until the girl started saying it back.
  

  
When we're trying to get Ora 5 to pay attention to us, we'll say "Look at my eyes." Now when he insists that we listen to him, he'll grab us and say "Look at my eyes."
