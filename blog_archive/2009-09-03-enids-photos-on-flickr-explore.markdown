[![A Bright Sunflower Day](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3432/3878949557_bcecf942d7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/enidmartindale/3878949557/)  
  
Just 4 days ago, Enid said that she would be really excited if her photos every got "explored" on Flickr. Since then, 5 of her photos have been explored.  
  
I'm not sure if the photos are hand selected by editors at Flickr or if there is an algorithm that is taking into account the number of people who have viewed, commented and made the photo a favorite etc., but Explore is a collection of the 500 most "interesting" photos on Flickr right now.
