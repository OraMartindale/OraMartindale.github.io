I'm not sure why, but Ora 5 wanted to read Tom Sawyer. I wasn't very enthusiastic, but I didn't want to dissuade his interest in a classic. My only knowledge of Tom Sawyer is from movies, so the only impression that I have of him is an obnoxious brat; However, in reading to Ora, I'm discovering an amazingly witty book with plenty of satire. Last night we read of Tom negotiating his way into getting a free bible in Sunday School and the admiration of Becky's father. Today we read about the main service. I thought these paragraphs were telling how good Twain's satire is and how much churches haven't changed:  


<blockquote>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doomâ€”a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.  
  
And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.</blockquote>
