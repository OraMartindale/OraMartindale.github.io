My friend Kevin visited a long while back and was impressed with how easily Ora is able to get around to his favorite Internet sites.. Well another friend had the same experience, but with Aspen. Joel was visitting and Aspen walked to the computer, opened Firefox, clicked to her favorite websites and beginning playing a game. I've played on the computer with Aspen a lot and showed her how to move a mouse and click and Ora shows her when he is on the computer as well.   
  
I may have said this before, but I really didn't touch a computer until the 7th grade. It will be very interesting to see if this early knowledge of computers tranlates into useful skills as adults.
