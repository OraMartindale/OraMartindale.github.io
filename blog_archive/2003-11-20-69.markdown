**Max Day 3**
  
I'm feeling better today. I still have a sore throat and an occasional small headache, but doing much better overall.
  

  
So far today, I've gone to classes on how to deploy Contribute in your organization, OOP in CF, and building Flash Components in ActionScript. They've all been really good. I'm much more pleased overall with the sessions this year than last. They keep getting better.
  

  
I also filled out the Conference Survey and got a grey MAX fleece jacket for my troubles. The weather has been in the 50s and 60s so I'll probably wear it instead of my heavy winter coat.
  

  
This evening they're taking us to the Olympic Oval, where all the ice skating events were at during the 2002 Olympics. We'll be able to use speed, figure or hockey skates to skate around the oval. There will also be curling, test your slap shot and Battle of the DJs and, of course, bungee jumping. I'm betting that one will be a long line. But why do I need to sign a waiver? =)
