Enid has been doing a lot of great work with her photography. Today was a validation of how skilled she has become when her photo became the main photo of [Pioneer Woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/)'s photography blog. Pioneer Woman is a very popular blog and she recently won several [webby awards](http://www.webbyawards.com/). Click the photo below to see a bigger picture of Enid's work on Pioneer Woman:
