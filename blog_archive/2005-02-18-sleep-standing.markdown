We took our daughter into walk-in hours at the doctor (she has ear infections in both ears and a throat problem), so we woke Ora 5 at 6:45 and got him out the door. Getting up 2-3 hours early didn't help his attitude all day. When I arrived home he was asleep. My told me that he walked up to her, rested his head on her legs and fell asleep standing!
