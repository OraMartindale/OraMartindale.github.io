Ora recieved his allowance tonight and as usual the $3 was burning a hole in his pocket. He took me back to Wal-Mart's toy department. "I want to dance on TV," he said.   
He lead me to a row that had a Fisher Price device that had a microphone and a camera. It allows you to plug it into your TV and watch yourself dance and sing. The demo encourages this even in children who need little encouragement: Ora.  
  
"How much is it?" Ora asked.  
  
"Ora, that's $60. It's 20 times the money you have."  
  
"20 times?" Ora said a bit surprised and disappointed symultaneously. He thought for a moment and then looked at the Fisher Price Digital Camera for kids. "What about this one?"  
  
"It's $60, too. Ora if you want to buy stuff like that you are going to have to not spend your money today and keep it until you have enough."  
  
"No."  
  
"Then you could wait until Christmas." (The Digital Camera is what we have bought for him for Christmas.)  
  
"But, Christmas is over."
