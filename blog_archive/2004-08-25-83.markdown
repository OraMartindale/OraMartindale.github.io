**I hurt everywhere**
  
When I was laying down the tile, I did a little bit at a time over 5 days, so the most time I spent on my knees was an hour to 1.5 hours. Tonight I spent 4.5 hours on my knees grouting and sponging. My neck, back, hands, fingers, hips, knees, legs and feet all hurt. But it looks beautiful.
  

  
Next Step: Sealing the grout.
