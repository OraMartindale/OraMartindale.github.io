I finished reading the book DisneyWar. It chronicles the years of Michael Eisner at Disney from the board room coup that brought him to Disney in 1984 to the shareholder revolt that brought him down in 2003-2004.   
  
The book is very fairly written although Disney claims inaccuracies because of a reliance on former employees who had an ax to grind. Instead of painting Eisner as the antichrist, it highlights his successes in the early years as well as his failures. Some have compared Eisner's rise and fall in the book to MacBeth.  
  
One of the amazing points of the book is the creative talent that Michael pitted against each other while they worked at Disney. As I read through the names of people who were fired or left Disney I felt that their lives, reputations and careers had been ruined. But the end of the book highlights that over 250 creative executives left Disney and went on to work at other places. The list reads like a Who's who of Internet and Entertainment companies including the heads of E! Television, Yahoo!'s Media and Entertainment Group, eBay, and Martha Stewart Omnimedia! They all (even ones that deserved to be fired) landed on their feet and are having great post-Disney careers. Imagine if Disney had nurtured this talent.
