This book is Clinton's call to all to change the world through giving of your time or money. The book reads like a laundry list of organizations and what they do. The last 3rd of the book is devoted to environmental issues and doesn't give a lot of concrete examples of how citizens can be involved or organizations that can help.  
  
Clinton ends with a note that millions of people giving small amounts would do more than one or two billionaires giving all their money (I had hoped most of the book would be dedicated to this idea) and a call for all people of religious faiths that their own religions all have a requirement to give.
