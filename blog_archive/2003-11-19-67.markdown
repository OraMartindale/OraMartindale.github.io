**Max Day 1, wrapup**
  
After lunch my class went from okay to awesome. A lot of great information and new ideas to use.
  

  
We went to the airport to pick up Bryan and Jim. I had asked a local guy and he said the TRAX (light rail system) did not go all the way to the airport.
  

  
We walked around in search of a place to eat. We arrived at a place called the Gateway and I saw it.
  

  
"That was a Segway."
  

  
"Where?" B.J. queried.
  

  
"It just went around the corner." We walked to the corner to find it.
  

  
"Um, Ora. Look down there." B.J. was pointing to the lower level where two Segways glided into a Segway store. We walked into the store and all plunked down $12 for a half hour ride on a Segway. We went out in a gruop of 8 and rode around the sidewalks. "IT" was an amazing experience. I'll post pictures later.
