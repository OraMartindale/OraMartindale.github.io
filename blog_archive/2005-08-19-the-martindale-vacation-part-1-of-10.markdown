_I originally promised to have a journal of our summer vacation on this site months ago. I apologize to both people who read my blog for taking so long to get this finished. This is broken up into a day-by-day account of the trip in 10 installments and post-dated them, so the date you see on the post is the date these events occured. I hope you enjoy._  
  
I hate fishing. I’ve known that for a long time. I just never knew the depths to which my hatred could go. It took Wal-Mart to show me. I was standing in the sporting goods section staring at an entire aisle of fishing equipment when the memories flooded back.  
  
It’s two days before we leave on our vacation. We’ll get supplies today, groceries tomorrow, pack up the car and in two weeks we will have memories of standing atop the Great Smoky Mountains, touring the largest private home in the country and a father full of trepidation trying to catch his intrepid son on the top of Chimney Rock.   
  
But right now I have been sent by my wife to look at fishing supplies for the trip and different memories are before me now. I remember standing for what seemed to be hours on the banks of small ponds not catching anything. I remember my brother and sister catching fish while I caught nothing. I remember my brother casting and the fish jumping up to grab the bait before it had even hit the water. I remember my sister pulling in fish after fish and when I walked over to where she was standing, the fish stopped biting.  
  
Jealousy and bitterness have probably tainted these memories, but those are the memories, as they exist now. Standing there I realize that I have no idea what I’m doing. I see kids’ poles with tackle boxes. _That’s helpful_, I say to myself. _But this other rod and reel has this other character on it, but it has no tackle box. But then I’ll need to buy a tackle box. What do I put in a tackle box?_ I turn around and face the other side of the aisle, filled with a thousand hooks, lures, sinkers and thingamabobbers. _Which of these do I need to begin a tackle box?_ My mind begins to calculate the cost of getting started to buy all the supplies I would need for the joy of catching nothing.  
  
I then find myself sympathizing with a group of people that I never thought I would: That father whose son takes an interest in soccer instead of football, or whose daughter is now in ballet and he must go to each performance. "I have nothing in common with those guys," I say. "I don’t mind if my son likes soccer or painting. Or a daughter who likes ballet. As long as it’s not fishing."  
  
I leave Wal-Mart without any fishing equipment. I tell my wife that I just can’t bring myself to fish.
