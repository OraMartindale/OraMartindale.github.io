Kids have amazing memories. I decided to show Ora 5 Star Wars while we were at my parents. The original, unaltered version. Empire Strikes Back being the best Star Wars movie, and since he won't understand the storyline, I decided we would watch that. It's the only one we had a chance to watch and he enjoyed it.  
  
Friday, the trailer for Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith came out and I watched it. The moment the music started, he yelled "Star Wars" and ran over to watch.  
  
Then tonight we were in Wal-Mart. The have posters of Yoda and Darth Vader promoting a special event at Wal-Mart. Ora walked up to them and said "Look, Yoda."  
  
I'm just so proud!
