We're in Havensville for the Independence Day celebration and we brought our bikes, so Enid and I got up early and rode from Havensville to Onaga (6.25 miles) and back. We are still on our mountain bikes so we were slower than we would be on road bikes, but we had an average moving speed of 9.7 MPH which we felt pretty good about especially since we also hit 3 good hills. This was Enid's first experience with those, but she did fine, but her gears need adjusted a bit.
