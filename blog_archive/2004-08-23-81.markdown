**Mark of the Beast and an Insignificant Church**
  
In one of my first classes at DeVry a professor told us that as technology professionals in a fast changing industry we would have to deal with social issues and specifically mentioned the Mark of the Beast.
  

  
6 years later it is obvious that George Orwell is more significant in influencing the culture than the Church is when an article can be written about the embedding RFID chips in humans (to allow financial transactions among other things) and it is described as "Orwellian" and not "Biblical."
