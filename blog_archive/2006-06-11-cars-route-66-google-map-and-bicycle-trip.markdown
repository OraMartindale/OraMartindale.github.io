I took the family to see Disney/Pixar's Cars last night. Once again Pixar has done it again. I've seen a lot of reviews that said it was good, but didn't live up to other Pixar films, but I didn't agree. I was moved more by this movie than any of the previous ones. Even Jesse's abandonment by Emily.  
  
It was during the credits that I realized that John Lasseter has complete control of the audience. As the credits began everyone got up to leave, but then the funny scenes started; not outtakes this time, but great stuff! The audience laughed harder at these parts than at many parts of the movie and caught inside jokes. Then the credits slammed you into reverse by going immediately from the funniest stuff of the show to a tribute to Joe Ranft who died last year. The screen showed Heimlich from A Bug's Life and Joe's name and years of birth and death. The audience quickly went from laughter to silence. I heard one man whisper "Honey, he died." Then softly from another part of the theater: "Oh my." Then to my right a couple of aisles down: "He did all those voices" as pictures of the binoculars and Wheezy from Toy Story appeared. Audience moved with the credits. In 3 seconds the whole tone of the audience had changed and I realized what complete control John Lasseter had over all of us.  
  
After seeing the movie, I began to wonder about Route 66. Where does it run? Could I find a map for it? Part of it goes through Kansas. Doesn't it? I did a little research and quickly found some sites about Route 66 including some amazingly detailed turn by turn maps. Since I had been researching Google Maps for a project at work I decided to give a map of Route 66 a try.  
  
I spent 2 or 3 hours working on it today (while neglecting my kids and wife) and got the [basic path down and put one point on it](/maps/route66/). It would be neat to spend the time to put all the points of interest on it, but I don't know if I'll have the time. But if I do, I at least have the starting point.  
  
I also created a quick map of the [Apostle Paul's first missionary journey](/maps/bible/paul_1.asp). It's a bit difficult since Google Maps doesn't have city's for most of the modern middle east yet, so I had to guess at some city locations. It's just a first draft as well. If I had known how easy the JavaScript is for Google Maps I would have been playing with this a year ago.  
  
I also started looking for bicycle trips of Route 66. I haven't found much yet expect a [grueling 29 day trip](http://www.pactour.com/route66.htm) with 7 centuries involved. I don't think I'm ready for that. I don't know if I mentioned it here yet, but I promised Rick I would go on the [BAK](http://www.bak.org/) with him in 2007, so I need to start getting in shape for it. This years BAK starts today. I got out my bike last week and took both Ora and Aspen around the block. They both hated it. =)
