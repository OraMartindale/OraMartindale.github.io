I took my car for an oil change this morning. When they were done, I paid, walked to the door and saw my van pulling up, so I began walking out. I saw a gentleman walking in with keys that looked like mine.  
  
"Are those for the van?" I asked pointing at the keys.  
  
"Yeah. Here you go," he replied and handed them to me.  
  
I began to think that this would be a really good place to try some [social engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29) and walk away with someone else's car.
