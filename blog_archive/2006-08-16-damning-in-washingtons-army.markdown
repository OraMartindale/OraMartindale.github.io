I'm listening to 1776 by David McCullough. In it he tells that a soldier in George Washington's army would get 20 lashings for striking an officer and 30 for damning an officer.  
  
It amazes me that we take the word "damn" so lightly that it is barely considered a curse word anymore and in 1776 they felt that wishing a man be damned to hell a worse offense than striking him.
