_This is part 9 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
Saturday we had a leisurely awakening and didn’t leave for our next destination, Chimney Rock, until around 10:30. It was 11:20 before we arrived 30 miles later. Again,  I’m used to Kansas where 30 miles means 30 minutes.  
  
Chimney Rock is a large rock outcropping in the Appalachian mountains. You have seen parts of it, if you have seen the finale (or even the commercials or movie posters) for Last of the Mohicans. We looked around a bit and decided to have lunch since it was so close to noon, but Ora insisted that he wanted to the top, so we rented a backpack to carry Aspen and walked through a tunnel to an elevator that took us up.  
  
The woman running the elevator, saw Ora and said “Where are you from?” Ora looked at me as if to ask if to say “what do I say?”  
  
I said “Where are you from?” Ora shied up. “Can you tell her Kansas City?” He looked up at her.  
  
“I love the Chiefs,” she said. She then showed Ora how to push the buzzer to get the elevator to come and how to work it.  
  
When we got to the top, we walked through a gift shop and then were at the rock. We had to take a staircase that spanned the chasm between the mountain and rock outcropping. I was scared. I walked up the stairs, looked around quickly and said I was going back down. Enid was also nervous up there, but Ora was everywhere. He would run up to the fence and look out, then run along the fence to another part. Since Enid was gingerly approaching all edges, she had trouble catching him.  
  
We then decided to go have lunch, but Ora wanted to go on the cliff trails. We knew if we were that scared on the safer part, the “difficult” trails would not be a success. We convinced Ora to go down and have lunch first.  
  
After lunch, we walked along the easiest trail. Along the way we stopped at the Moonshiners’ cave, a deep cavern where illegal wiskey makers used to hide. We then continued on the trail. It was a 1.5 mile round trip that took us to the bottom of a large waterfall. It was a difficult trip with Aspen on my back, but it was worth it.

After we returned from the trail, Ora said he wanted to back up to the top again. I was able to stay at the top a little longer this time, but the episode from earlier was repeated: slow moving parent; fast moving son.

We went back down the stairs and into the gift shop where the elevator was located. We stopped and bought ice cream for everyone and headed back to the elevator. The woman from earlier was running the elevator again. She saw Ora’s ice cream and said “Is that for me?” Ora pulled his ice cream back towards him and turned his body to protect it. “Aaah,” she said in disappointment.  
  
After that it was back to camp. We needed to do laundry. I took the kids and played at the playground while Enid washed the clothes.   
  
That night as Enid was sitting by the fire the camp chair broke as she was sitting on it. Just add that equipment failure on top of the lantern problems. I put out the fire that evening and went to bed.  
  
The bed deflated part way through the night. I woke up to air the mattress again and noticed the fire was going. I made my way to the door of the tent and heard a noise. I looked toward the table and saw an animal, but couldn’t see what it was in the dark. I used the flashlight, and a raccoon looked right at me and then ran off. I had forgotten to put our bag of trash in the trashcan. I got up, put the trash into the trashcan and then poured a bottle of water on fire. I then returned to bed,  re-aired the mattress and went to bed.  
  
Later in the night I awoke again. Looking out of the tent I saw that the fire was going again. _Oh, just ignore it_, I thought, but then years of seeing Smokey the Bear on Saturday mornings telling me “Only you can prevent forest fires” came back to me. I had been well indoctrinated. I got up, got a pot full of water this time and poured water all over the fire pit. I then returned to the tent,  re-aired the mattress and went to bed.
