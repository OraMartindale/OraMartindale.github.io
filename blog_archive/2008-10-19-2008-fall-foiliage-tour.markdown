Enid and I have biked all summer in anticipation of an organized bike ride. Unfortunately our plans to ride the Octoginta fell through since that ride fell on the same weekend as our church's missions conference. Since we weren't going to be able to ride the Octoginta, our training had fallen off a bit until Enid found the Missouri Bike Federation's Fall Foliage Tour.  
  
The ride was just north of Jefferson City, MO, so we got up early and battled thick fog to make it there and the temperature started out at around 50° but warmed to 60°. About 150 riders participated in 30, 60 and 100 mile rides.   
  
We did the 30-mile ride (actually 34 miles) and it was nice; however, it felt like we were always in a small town. Even when we got out of the towns there were still large houses on 5 acre lots. Enid commented that she enjoyed our training ride around Havensville, KS, more because we were out in the country. Here are some of the pictures:  
  
This is taken from the first SAG stop. These bikers are all slowing down to stop and grab a snack:

This is one of the few places that didn't have any houses or towns. It reminded me of a stretch of road north of Havensville. That's Enid ahead of me.

Towards the end of the ride (at the bottom of a long hill) was this bridge. I stopped to get a picture of Enid as she crossed over it. One lady shouted to me playfully mocking: "Don't you know you're supposed to stop at the top of the hills not the bottom?"

When we got done, I stopped and talked to Brent Hugh, the organizer of the [Missouri Bicycle Federation](http://www.mobikefed.org). We put our bikes onto our van and talked with a gentleman who rides a recumbent bike. He told us how much he liked it over his old "upwrong" bike. Then Enid and I had lunch at a local family-style diner.  
  
It was a great ride and a great end to the summer season. The challenge now will be finding some time for some winter rides so we start out next spring in as good of shape as we are now.
