We recently paid off our credit cards. Hurrah! So tonight I began calling credit card companies and canceling the cards.   
  
The first was Discover. After talking with the initial customer service representative, she told me she could not cancel the card and sent me to the cancellation group. These guys are the ones paid to make sure you never cancel a card.  
  
"My name is John. How can I help you?"  
  
"I would like to cancel my card."  
  
"I'm sorry to here that. Is there something that Discover did to make you unhappy?"  
  
"No. I'm paying off all my cards and would like to cancel them now."  
  
"I see that we can offer you a low interest rate on balance transfers. If you would like to transfer any balances to this card, I can help you with that."  
  
"No. As I said, I've paid off all my cards and I just want to cancel the card."  
  
"But we could also transfer a car loan onto the card if you would like."  
  
Boy there's a stupid idea! "No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"We show that you have earned $[don't remember the dollar amount] cash back. Wouldn't you like to keep your card and continue to earn cash back?"  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"There's 19 cash-back dollars you would be forfeiting by canceling your card. Are you sure you don't want to keep that $19."  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"Could we offer you a lower interest rates or airline miles or something else?"  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"Is there something that Discover did to make you unhappy?"  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"Okay, sir. Well I'll cancel your card for you."  
  
"Thank you."  
  
Discover was just the warm up. I called Chase next. Again the first person I spoke to had to transfer me to the cancellation group.  
  
"Hi this is Sandra [last name omitted]. I understand you want to cancel your credit card. I see you have been a customer of ours for 4 and a half years. We really hate to see someone who has been a customer with us for so long leave. Is there anything I could do to keep you as a customer?"  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"Perhaps a low balance transfer or a lower rate or airline miles or bonus points?"  
  
"No. I'd just like to cancel the card."  
  
"Wouldn't you like to at least keep this card open in case of emergencies?"  
  
"No. We're going to use cash for that."  
  
Then she began to get a tone that sounded somewhat offended: "Well, it sounds like your mind is made and there's nothing I can say that would change your mind."  
  
"That's correct."  
  
Then she adopted the if-I-can't-have-it-my-way-then-I'm-going-to-take-my-ball-and-go-home tone: "Well sir, then we are going to close your credit cards. That will happen immediately so you will not be able to use your cards, so you can cut them up if you want. We will also be notifying the 3 major credit scoring companies within the next 30 days. Please know, that if you should decide to try to apply for the card again, it will be based on your credit score at that time and not on your credit score now."  
  
"Thank you."  
  
After that call I was feeling pretty good. It was nice to be the one in control instead of begging for a lower rate. I called the others and canceled them one by one. The easiest turned out to be Target which allows you to cancel your card through their automated phone prompts.
