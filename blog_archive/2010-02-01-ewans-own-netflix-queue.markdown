More and more Ewan has been wanting to choose his own movies to watch. He's no longer content watching the girly stuff his older sister watches or the older stuff his brother watches. Often Aspen would take Ewan to her own Netflix queue and help him pick out movies and then add them to her queue for him; however, when Ewan was gone she would either move them to the bottom of her list or remove them entirely so that they would not supersede her own movie selections.  
  
So we setup Ewan with his own Netflix queue and today he got his first movie, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. Enid tells me that "you've never seen a child so happy as when he got his own movie in the mail."
