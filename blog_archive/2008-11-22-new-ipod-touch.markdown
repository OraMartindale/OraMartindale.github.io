Enid and I don't buy Christmas gifts for each other, but instead we take the money we would have spent and spend it on something we want for ourselves. Soooo much less stress!  
  
We were shooting around some ideas, including pooling our money and buying a Wii, until one morning as I was borrowing her iPod again, she said, "You need to buy yourself a new iPod." So, I did. I found a good deal on Craigslist and Ora 5 and I went up today to pick up my new iPod Touch.
