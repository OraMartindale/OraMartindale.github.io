Well, by now most have heard that George Lucas said that Revenge of the Sith will be darker than then other 5 Star Wars movies and that he wouldn't take a 5 or 6-year old kid to see it. At first I was disappointed, because I've looked forward to taking Ora 5 to see Episode 6 for 3 years. I've prepped him by getting him interested in space ships and then cultivating that interest into a desire to watch Empire Strikes Back. He now trolls the Wal-Mart aisles looking for colored plastic sabers to swing at weak-minded shoppers.  
  
So I began to think that I wouldn't take 5 to see Star Wars and then it occurred to me: George Lucas is the idiot who thought Star Wars: A New Hope was going to be a flop, even as he sat across the street from the Chinese Theatre not realizing the lines were to see his movie.  
  
This is the moron who thought the Phantom Menace was a great start to the Star Wars saga.  
  
This is the nerd who told us that Attack of the Clones was a love story. Millions of unwitting nerds now believe that they can woo a girl using lines like "I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth."  
  
So for each of the three movies that he has directed so far he has failed to accomplish his expectations. Will this Star Wars be "darker?" Given the fall of Anakin, I don't see how it couldn't be, but I have faith that George can screw it up and once again trample on our childhoods. See you there in May!
