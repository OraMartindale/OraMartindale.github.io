**Another Sick Sunday**
  
Well, for the second time in a month Ora 5 is sick this weekend. He started to wind down early last night which wasn't unusual since we had been outside and about town a lot yesterday. However, after he woke up from a short nap, his mom was caring him around and he threw up down the front of his mom. I immediately jumped up and took him; I knew Enid's week stomach was going to send her off for her own round.
  

  
Ora coughed vomit into my face and then leaned over to throw up some more. When he was finished we waited for his mom to get done in the bathroom so I could clean Ora up. Once he was cleaned up I gave him back to his mother so I could begin cleaning up the floor and bathroom and removing all soiled clothing and towels to the laundry room. After starting that small load of laundry, it was back upstairs to Lysol everything.
