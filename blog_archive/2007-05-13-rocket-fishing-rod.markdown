We told Ora 5 that if he sold some of his toys at our garage sale, he could keep all the proceeds. We also encouraged him to do a lemonade stand. Afterwards, Ora 5 had hauled in $15 and had enough to buy his Rocket Fishing Rod. We went to Dick's sporting goods to get it and I was so proud. He has been saving his money for almost a year and he paid for it, we took it home and he practiced in the front yard. He even took it to church to show his friends.  
  
I thought that it would be a cheap piece of junk, but it actually holds up pretty well. Now to do a little more fishing with Ora.
