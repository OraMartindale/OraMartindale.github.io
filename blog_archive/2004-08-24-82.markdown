**"This is fun"**
  
While cleaning the newly laid tile in my kitchen in preparation for grouting the following evening, I was listening to the Chiefs on the radio. I left the room and Ora 5 switched it to CD mode and LoneStar started playing. I walked in to find him dancing. So we danced around to LoneStar and he declared "This is fun!."
  

  
I wonder how many other full sentences are rolling around in his head waiting to come out?


  

  


**The first dance**
  
After Ora 5 tired of dancing, Enid told me it was Aspen's turn. So I had my first dance with my daughter: A country waltz. I began imagining a time years from now when I'll get the second dance at her wedding.
