**The episode of Blue's Clues that never aired**
  
Steve: "We've found our 3rd Blue's clue. You know what that means? Time to sit in our thinking chair. Right! Our first clue was a boot. The second clue was a door and our third clue was a record album. What could Blue be telling me to do with the rest of my life with a boot a door and a record album? Hmm... What if the boot kicked me out the door? And then I went and created a record album with the Flaming Lips? Blue, should I leave Blue's Clues and go create a rock and roll album?"
  

  
Blue: "Uh huh."
  

  
Steve: "We just figured out Blue's clues."
  

  
Ora and I love watching Blue's Clues together on Saturday mornings. Honestly I was watching it before he was born. Here's [what Steve's doing now](http://www.steveswebpage.com/). And you can buy his album: [Songs for Dustmites](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AINL3/qid=1064926239/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-7858680-9223200?v=glance&s=music). I have a feeling it's not in the same vein as Blue's Clues albums.
