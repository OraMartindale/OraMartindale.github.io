Ewan's birthday is tomorrow, but we're partying today. Family came over to celebrate with an amazing Thomas the Tank Engine cake. It is actually shaped like Thomas! My wife saw a picture of it and ordered it via phone, but never asked how much it was. When I went to pick it up and they asked me is it the "$44.99 signature cake?" In my mind I thought _I hope not_. But it was. LOL. Happy Birthday Ewan.
