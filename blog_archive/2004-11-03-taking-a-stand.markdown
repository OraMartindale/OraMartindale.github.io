Voting is an interesting process in our family. Since the polling place is only two streets over, I go and vote, drive home and then Enid goes to vote and then I go to work. When I arrived, there was a line; inside, not outside. There was not even a line in 2000 and that was a high turn-out year. The line moved quickly and I was in, out and home in 10 minutes; as opposed to some in Ohio who waited 10 hours to vote! I'm not that patriotic.
  

  
Then Enid went to vote, and I cared for Aspen who had awoken two hours early. We were sitting on the floor playing and she was sitting in front of me. She grabbed each of my hands with hers and pulled herself up into a standing position. I was a proud dad.
