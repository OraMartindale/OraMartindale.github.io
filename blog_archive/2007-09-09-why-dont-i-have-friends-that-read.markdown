My wife and I were talking the other night and she commented that she doesn't know anyone who reads. I began thinking about this as well and realized that outside of my family, I could think of only 1 person that I _know_ reads. This seems very odd to me.  
  
Update: A friend emailed me and said "Hey, I read. And [my wife] reads." So that makes three people I know. Still seems like a really small group.
