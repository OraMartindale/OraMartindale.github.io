We went to the Kansas City Literature Festival today. It was a lot of fun and we came home with free books, free bookmarks, free bags and Enid bought a shirt that says "Don't judge a book by its movie."  
  
Wonderscope, the local childrens' museum had a large hands on area. Here Ora is decorating a book:
