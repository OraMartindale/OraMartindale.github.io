I was singing _Row, row, row your boat_ with the kids in the car. After finishing Ora 5 asked:  
  
"Who's Spud?"  
  
"Spud? You mean in the song?"  
  
"Yeah."  
  
"There is no Spud."   
  
I sang it again. "Did you hear Spud?"  
  
"Yeah."  
  
"Okay, I'm going to sing it one more time. When you hear 'Spud', you yell, 'There.'"  
  
Row, row, row your boat  
Gently down the steam  
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily  
Life is but a...  
  
"There!"  
  
"Is but?"  
  
"Yeah."
