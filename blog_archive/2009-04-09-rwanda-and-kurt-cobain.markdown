I've been reading a lot about Rwanda lately on the 15th anniversary of the genocide that occurred there. I wondered why I don't remember anything about it when it was going on. Then I saw another article that said today was the 15th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide. _Oh, yeah. I remember that_, I thought.
