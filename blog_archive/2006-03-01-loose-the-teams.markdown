A coworker asked me how I was going to vote on the proposed Stadium improvements for the Chiefs and the Royals. I've been torn on this issue. On one hand, if I'm going to pay $600+ million dollars why aren't we talking about new stadiums. I would gladly pay twice that for new stadiums than pay that for "improvements" to the current stadiums.   
  
I'd also like to see a serious discussion about  
  
I decided to take a look at the campaigns "Keep the Teams!" site. At the bottom of the first page of the site (which in my professional opinion as a web developer is aweful!) they had two paragraphs that really angered me:  
  


<blockquote>Should voters reject Question 1, the teams will be free to leave the Kansas City market. That is the reality.  
  
Every imaginable option or alternative has been discussed over the past several months, from the Chiefs moving to Kansas to the Royals moving to a downtown baseball stadium. These are fantasies, conjured up by those who want escape the reality that it is our obligation as owners of the Truman Sports Complex to maintain and improve it. </blockquote>

  
This statement shows exactly how much animosity there is in the Jackson County government towards anyone who wants to explore any other idea. I immediately decided to vote NO! Once this proposal is defeated, I guarantee that a Kansas stadium will be a valid proposal. (The Kansas governer has already talked to the Chiefs.) And a downtown stadium will be back on the drawing board. Maybe we'll have a real discussion about it this time instead of it being swept under the run as a "fantasy."  
  
So, I say "Vote NO! Loose the Teams!"  
  
Lamar Hunt, we love you and we love the Chiefs, but this proposal isn't good enough.  
  
David Glass... well, we love the Royals. We think you're a cheapscate who runs the Royals like you did Wal-Mart and is stealing millions of dollars in revenue sharing to line your own pockets.  
  
So, I can now tell my coworker how I will vote on April 4th.
