Mashups are the big things in web apps right now. It's when you take data from one internet source and combine it with data from another source to create a cool useful tool. There are even [unconferences for mashups](http://news.com.com/At+Mashup+Camp%2C+geeks+plot+future+of+Web/2100-1012_3-6151162.html). The most common mashup is taking data and plotting it on a Google map.  
  
Today, Rick and I were looking at the tracking information for a UPS package and he placed the cities into Yahoo! Maps Beta manually. It suddenly dawned on us that we could place those points into Google Maps programmatically. Ideas started pouring forth:  
  
"We could draw a polyline to each point."  
  
"And pop-up bubbles for each stop showing when it arrived and when it left."  
  
"This could be your mashup!" I declared to Rick. His eyes lit up, but suddenly reality hit us. "Someone has probably already done this." We searched and found [Package Mapping](http://www.packagemapping.com) which allows you to track your UPS, Fedex, USPS, or DHL packages using a Google Map.  
  
Guess we'll keep looking for our mashup.
