Grandma and Papa have been wanting to have Ora spend a week with them. We explained to Ora that they wanted to have him, but he couldn't go until he had no more potty training accidents. He continued to have accidents and we explained that he would not be able to go to Grandma and Papa's house if he kept having accidents.  
  
Grandma and Papa came up for the 4th of July weekend and the accidents immediately stopped. His usual one-a-day accident rate ended. Enid and I thought he must have stopped having accidents because he wanted to go, so we let him.  
  
I wasn't there to see him go, but Enid said he was really excited to go, but then he told mom to come. She explained that she was not going. He was sad, but continued to get his stuff ready. As he left, he was crying that he was leaving mommy, but he rolled his suitcase out and left. Enid said "you could tell he really wanted to go, but was sad that he was leaving mommy."
