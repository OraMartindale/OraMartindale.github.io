**4 DVD Players**
  
Well, my in-laws outdid themselves and bought Enid and me a DVD player with surround sound system. I've hooked it up and it's amazing, but it left us with 4 DVD players, that's right 4, and a slight dilema. One is in my laptop, one in the X-Box, one stand-alone wedding present, and the new one that hooks up the surround sound which means two hook up to the TV. Well, it became obvious which one would go, so I'd like to say thanks to a great group of guys. 
  

  
Several guys pooled their money and purchased Enid and my's first stand-alone DVD player as a wedding gift. I was very surprised. We have used it for 3 years now and love it. In fact the on-screen interface is still the best I've ever seen. No laptop, X-Box, or anything else I've seen has as user-friendly a display as the Panasonic that has now graced our tiny TV screen for 3 years. I'm now giving it to my brother and I hope he'll have long years of use with it.
  

  
Thanks guys for years of popcorn, adventure, explosions, tears, laughter and everything else that's part of the movie experience.
