It's been a long while since I posted. I've added some back-dated posts, so be sure to check the archives. Particularly the last September ones about Ora 5 biking.  
  
The biggest news that has happened in recent months is Ewan's growth. Although, I don't understand him, Enid can interpret some of his words. He has almost half a mouth of teeth (why don't teeth grow in symmetrically?). And he is walking everywhere; he's almost running. He had taken some ginger steps in the past months, but a few weeks back he looked at something on the other side of the room and decided to walk to it. You could see it in his eyes as he looked at it. So, he stood and took several steps to it. Buoyed by this newly-found talent, he spent the rest of the day trying to get to things by walking.  
  
My joy at watching his first deliberate attempt to attain something by walking to it was briefly interrupted when I thought that he would no longer crawl and that I would have no more babies that crawled around my house.
