I was getting out paints for the kids to paint pictures. I placed paper for them to paint on, gave them brushes and squeezed blobs of paint onto paper plates for them.  
  
"Go to town, kids," I said when finished.  
  
"Go to town?" Ora questioned, obviously not understanding.  
  
"Oh, um... start painting."
