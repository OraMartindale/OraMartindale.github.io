Ora walked into the kitchen and handed me a printout from one of his favorite sites. It had his name at the bottom. I stopped and took a second look. I had typed his name into the site earlier but we had left that section of the site and I had typed his name in all lower case. This had a capital "O"!  
  
"Ora, did you type your name?"  
  
"Yes." Skeptical, I returned him to the computer. He proceeded to type o-r-a!
