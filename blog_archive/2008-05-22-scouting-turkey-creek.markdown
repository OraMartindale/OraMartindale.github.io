Over my lunch break today, I scouted the Turkey Creek Trail for a future bike ride.  
  
Later I created a Google Map for it: http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110458830198340812249.00044dc1c392a5b8ee0c4&z=13  
  
Once we get over to ride it, I'll add any other details I find to the map.
