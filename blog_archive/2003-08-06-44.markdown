**The Punisher meets the Martindales**
  
![](http://www.apple.com/trailers/artisan/images/the_punisher_poster.jpg)After years of cutting his teeth on short films, television pilot scripts and commercials, my brother is going to be working on a major motion picture. He has been hired as a Production Assistant for the 2nd unit of _The Punisher_.
  

  
The second unit crew films anything that doesn't not involve the main actor. That includes sunrises, sunsets, a view of the city and, as Orion says, "we get to blow stuff up."
  

  
For all you fans of '80s comic books, I don't have to explain who The Punisher is, but for anyone else, he's basically a renegade who is seeking revenge for the death of his family. But that's all I really know about him. During my childhood, I remember my Uncle Chris was a big comic book fan, and Wolverine and Punisher were always his favorites.
  

  
Filming was supposed to start this week, and he would be on the job for a couple months. He had everything lined up as far as where to stay, etc, but then the budget changed. Now the second unit crew will only be needed for 2 weeks. This means that Orion has lost his place to stay and may have to hotel it, which could make the whole job a loss. The exciting part about the change is that he may be able to accept a job for a movie that's going to be filming in Wamego, Kansas. 
  

  
Either way, Orion, we're all proud of you, and I'll be in the theaters next summer cheering; not at the movie but at your name in the credits.
