I remember asking dad to take the training wheels off my bike. It may have been just after he put them on. None of my friends had training wheels and I didn't want them either. But after he took them off, I couldn't ride at all and asked him to put them back on; he refused. As a father I now understand that he didn't want to be taking them off and putting them back on repeatedly.   
  
Eventually, the boy across the street, Jared, taught me to ride without my training wheels.  
  
So when Ora 5 asked to take his training wheels off, I warned him that once they were off, they were not going back on. He insisted he did not want them anymore, so I took them off.  
  
I prepared for the quentisential moment when a father, holding on to the handlebar and the seat, brings his son up to speed and then releases him to fall a few times. Instead, I took a couple of steps with Ora and he insisted I let go and when I did, he glided easily down the street.

I was amazed. He figured out how to turn within a couple of minutes and we worked on stopping without falling over, but he picked up on it very fast.
