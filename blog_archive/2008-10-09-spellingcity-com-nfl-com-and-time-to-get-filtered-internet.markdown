Yesterday Ora 5 was having trouble spelling. Enid called me, frustrated, to ask if I had any suggestions. I asked what the words were and she gave me a few of them. "He should be able to spell those," I said.   
  
Today when I came, Enid said she had found spellingcity.com. It allows you to put in a list of words and then it will use those words to create games. Ora was able to spell every word and spent 45 minutes playing the games, Enid said.  
  
Later that evening, Ora wanted to show off what he could do on the computer: "Look, dad. I can go to nfl.com." He began typing on the keyboard and saying the letters as he typed: "W-w-w dot n-f-l dot com." He pressed enter and the NFL's website appeared on screen. _If he can spell that,_ I thought to myself, _he can spell www.sex.com. Time to buy an internet filter._
