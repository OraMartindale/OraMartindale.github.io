**Mustache**
  
Ora pointed at my stubble and said "Mustache." I was impressed. 
  

  
"That's very good, Ora."
  

  
He then pointed at his own upper lip and said "Mustache." Then pointed at Mom's upper lip; "Mustache." Then at Aspen's: "Mustache." I think he believes that "mustache" is the word for "upper lip."
