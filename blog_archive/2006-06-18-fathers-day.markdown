Early Sunday morning I decided it was time to get Ora up to go to church. Just as I was about to head to his room he came out holding a yellow gift bag with Superman on it.  
  
He had been waiting several days to give this to me. Enid took both kids to purchase Father's Day gifts a couple of days ago. Enid had expressly told Ora not to tell me what they bought and he had been struggling to keep it in. One night as I was lying beside Ora as he went to sleep he said "Father's Day..."  
  
"Don't tell me," I warned.  
  
"It's a secret," he replied.  
  
In the Superman bag was a card that had Superman and his son playing catch with a large bolder. Then I pulled out a new belt and a Superman tee-shirt. Being a skinny guy all my life, I've hesitated to by myself a Superman tee-shirt, but now that Ora bought me one I think I'll have to wear it. =)  
  
In a little bit Aspen woke up. She looked into the bag, pulled out the card she had bought for me and gave it to me. It was a Winnie the Pooh card whose arms opened up to give a hug. Enid said Aspen had picked it out and liked playing with it so much that Enid was afraid that Aspen would pull the "arms" off.  
  
After church we went to see _Cars_ for a second time. It was a very good Father's Day.
