The temp got above 50Â° today, so we packed up the bikes and headed for the trail. We had anticipated good weather, so we dropped by Dick's yesterday and dropped a bunch of money on cool-weather clothes for the kids.

The trails still had some snow and ice on them in places, but it was amazing the amount of sitting water puddled on the trail. We came home wet and dirty, but enjoyed our ride.

Ora 5 and Aspen both had personal bests: Aspen went 6 miles on her own, doubling her previous distance. Ora went 18 miles besting his best distance by 6 miles. By the end, I was having trouble keeping pace with him and he probably could have gone farther.
