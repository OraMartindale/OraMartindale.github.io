I had today off work for Columbus Day, so we decided to go for a bike ride. It was a good chance to test out Ora 5's new ability to bike. We put Aspen and Ewan in a trailer behind my bike and took one of the city's biking/walking trails. We had a good ride and when we were done I looked at the trail map and found that we had bike 5 miles.   
  
We then let Aspen and Ewan play on some playground equipment where our car was parked and Ora 5 did a half-mile loop. He did it twice! So Ora did a 6-mile bike ride today. I would not have dreamed he would have the stamina to do that.
