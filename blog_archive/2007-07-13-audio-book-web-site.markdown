Just finished listening to Pearl Harbor by Newt Gingrich (yes, that Newt). They advertised at the end of the audio book they said that you could here more interviews with the author at the audio book company's website. I thought this was a great way of extending the experience of the book to the website. That is if I could find the interviews that they were talking about.
