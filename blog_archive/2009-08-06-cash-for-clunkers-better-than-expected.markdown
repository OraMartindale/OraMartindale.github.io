A few days, I posted about the Cash for Clunkers program being amazingly successful. I had put some initial numbers to it, but my estimates while intentionally conservative, were way too conservative. CNN is reporting that the average "clunker" being turned in gets 15.8 mpg and the average new car being bought is 25.4 mpg. I'm going to simplify my math a bit: If 250,000 cars were purchased, that means that we have improved the national mpg by 2,400,000 mpg. If the Senate passes the $2 billion extension that means we could take 7.2 million mpg off the road!
