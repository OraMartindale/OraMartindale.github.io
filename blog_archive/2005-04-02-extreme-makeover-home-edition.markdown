One of our favorite shows, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, came to Kansas City this week. We went to take a look at the end of demolition day. If you're not familiar with the premise they take and extraordinary family and send them on a one-week vacation and while they are gone totally rebuild their house into a stylish, modern home.  
  
We drove a couple miles up the road and saw 79th street, where we knew the house was, but didn't know which way to turn. I saw people crossing the road heading to my left, so I decided to turn left. As I was waiting for a green light, a white van drove out of the street. Michael, one of the show's designers, was waiving from the window of the front passenger seat and the van's horn was honking. It was followed by a semi of dirt. It would be our only glimpse of the show's stars that day.  
  
We parked and walked to where the crowd was gathered. As we walked the two blocks, two more semis full of dirt passed. When we reached the house, we say that they completely demolished the house. In a row of houses there was a vacant space and large machinery was digging out a new basement. We stayed and watched for a bit and then headed home, planning to come back another day to see the progress.
