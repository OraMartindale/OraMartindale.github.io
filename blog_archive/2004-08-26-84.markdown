**Sealer and Furnishings**
  
Well, the floor looks great. I sealed it this evening with a new type of sealer that comes in a spray can. Instead of painting it on each grout line, you just walk down the line spraying a can of the stuff a foot off the ground. Done in 5 minutes, but almost passed out because of the fumes.
  

  
That done, I waited an hour and watched a couple episodes of The Tick and then began moving the oven, rolling cabinet, dishwasher and table back into the kitchen.
