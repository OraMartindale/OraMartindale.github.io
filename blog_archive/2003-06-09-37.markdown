**Rolling Hills Zoo**
  
Over Memorial Day weekend, while Enid, Ora and I were in Salina visiting Enid's parents, we went to Rolling Hills Zoo with Enid's dad, Curtis. It was a beautiful place. Just outside of Salina, it's a zoo with 80 different types of Animals. A local businessman created it and the surrounding land is owned by him and farmed for food for the animals. It's a wonderful example of a businessman giving back to the community.
  

  
Ora 5 was given a passport when we arrived and at various locations around the park were stations where he could stamp his passport. He loved it. He wanted to stamp it again and again and again. He began to even recognize the little stations and know to  go to them. When he was finished the gift shop entered the family into a drawing. The winner gets a family trip to Denver to visit the zoo. We'll have to visit some friends if we win. Second place is a trip to Kansas City. Oh boy.
