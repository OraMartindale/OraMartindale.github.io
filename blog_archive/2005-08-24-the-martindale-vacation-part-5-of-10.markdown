_This is part 5 of a 10-part series. If you would like to read them in order, please [start here](/2005/08/martindale-vacation-part-1-of-10.asp)._  
  
**Hike up Deep Creek**  
This morning was another slow start. We began the morning with breakfast and watching the church group tubing down the creek.  
  
Our first outing of the day was for a little hike up Deep Creek. The Deep Creek entrance to the park consists only of a parking area for people who want to hike up the creek. Although you can hike all the way up the mountains to the very peak we were at yesterday, our quest was a bit more modest: two waterfalls less than a mile up the trail. Ora quickly decided he didn’t want to hike and dawdled, laid on the ground and generally found any reason not to go on. With a little bit of coaxing he grudgingly came along.  
  
We found the first waterfall quickly and sat there for quite a while. Then it was on to a bridge. From the bridge the trail began to climb and we were soon about 50 feet above the creek. The trail leveled out and soon the river rose to meet it. We found another bridge just off the main path and looked at it for a while, then we turned to the right and climbed steeply for about 100 yards. Then a small offshoot trail stepped us down into a beautiful pool in front of a beautiful waterfall.  
  
It occurred to me that in our search we saw three things: A waterfall, a bridge and a waterfall. It reminded me of Ora and Aspen watching _Dora the Explorer_. There is always a map with three landmarks the kids must remember to help Dora on her journey. I wondered what possibilities existed for the National Park Service to team with Nickelodeon to create maps of their trails for children. A Dora map of where we were going could have really kept Ora’s interest.  
  
On the way back we stopped before the first bridge and the kids played throwing rocks into the river. I skipped rocks across the fast moving creek and Enid looked for salamanders. The brochures of the park and the Blue Ridge Parkway had a particular salamander that was red with black spots. We watched as some tubers went by. Enid didn’t find and salamanders, but she did find a set of keys and a quarter.  
  
**Mills and Farms**  
We went back to camp for a late lunch and then back into the south entrance of the park. On our way through Bryson City we passed by the cop car again.  
  
We first went to Milgar’s Mill. It was an impressive mill. The water was diverted off the stream and then sent through a man-made trough for about 100 yards. It was then diverted into an elevated water trough where the water was moved through an increasingly narrower channel to speed the water up. At the end of the channel the water entered and was forced down a brick column that put pressure on the water and then the water was forced through a pipe and passed the metal turbine that turned the mill wheel.  
  
We then went to the visitors’ center beside the old farm museum. I turned in the keys Enid had found. Ora and I went to the farm and Enid picked out some souvenirs.  
  
After that it was back to camp for dinner. After dinner it was time to do laundry. I played with Ora and Aspen at a playground beside the laundry building while Enid waited on a slow washer and dryer. I don’t remember my family doing laundry on vacations when I was a kid. It must have been done, but I don’t remember it. I wonder if I was off playing on some playground while mom was stuck with the washer and dryer.  
  
I purchased a fire candle from the camp’s office. It immediately lit and it burned for a half hour starting a great fire. I'm never going to go camping without one of those again!
