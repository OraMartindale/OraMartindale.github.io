We had great fun tonight riding with my uncle and cousins. They took us out to the southern end of the Haller trail and we rode up to Shawnee Mission park. There are some tremendous hills on the route. They wouldn't be so bad expect that they are not gradual inclines but very steep which is hard with the trailer and kids behind me.  
  
We saw a lot of dear out beside the trail as well. At the end of the ride, Ora 5 and my cousin rode ahead. I think Ora 5 liked the opportunity to bike with someone else and to break away from the pack.
