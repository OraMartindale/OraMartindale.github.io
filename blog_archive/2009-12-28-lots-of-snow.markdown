We left Wednesday for my in-laws where we spent Christmas. The forecast had called for rain turning into ice by 9pm, so we were trying to get out as early as possible. The first half hour was heavy rain; I took it slow and worried that it was only going to get worse. However, the rain cleared off and did not return for the rest of our trip. The worst we had was heavy fog in the flint hills. At one point the fog was so thick that cars' tail lights would disappear within seconds of passing me.  
  
We had some snow at the in-laws, but not much. We heard that Kansas City had a lot; enough that many churches canceled Sunday services. When we came back into town today, we found that the roads were very clear right up until we got onto the street to our house, but it wasn't too bad. Our driveway was covered and I had a bit of trouble getting up it.  
  
The first order of business was to scrape the driveway, but before I did I measured 5.5 inches of snow on it.
