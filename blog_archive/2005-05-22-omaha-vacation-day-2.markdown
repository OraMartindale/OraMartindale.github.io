We woke up the next morning early and heard birds chirping. We got up to fix pancakes for breakfast. We forgot the butter. Cold cereal this morning, we'd make pancakes the next.  
  
The weather had predicted thunderstorms today, but their wasn't a cloud in the sky. We had prayed several times for God to delay the storm. Lesson learned: prayer still works.  
  
We packed the kids into the car and headed for the Henry Doorly Zoo - the "event" of our Omaha trip. I had been there 11 summers ago, but the only big attraction they had at the time was the rainforest. Now they had an aquarium, a desert dome and were working on other attractions.  
  
We hit the rainforest first and Ora 5 and Aspen were thrilled. It was fun to walk through and see such an amazing building. Some of the birds would fly up to the walkways and let you touch them.  
  
After leaving the rainforest, Aspen's fever - which we had been watching carefully the day before - began to worsen. She had some type of bug bite on her arm and her lips turned a bit blue. We took her to the first aid station. They checked her oxygen level, on account of her blueness, but she was okay. We began to think that his could be the end our vacation. We called Aspen's pediatrician and described what was going on. He calmed our fears, told us what to do for us and then made small talk about vacationing in Omaha. We commented on how nice it was that we could call our pediatrician on a Saturday and he wanted to keep us on the phone to talk!  
  
During this time, I had to exit the zoo twice and get the phone and medicine from the car. Ora 5, Aspen and Enid went through the aquarium 3 times. They have an amazing penguin exhibit, shark tank and jellyfish tank!  
  
After this it was already time to eat lunch. We headed back to the rainforest where they had a cafeteria where you could eat overlooking the rainforest. A couple with older children laughed knowingly as Aspen and Ora dropped sippy cups with Sprite in them 3 times. When you drop a sippy cup with a carbonated beverage in it, the drop acts like shaking the can before opening it does. The whole thing suddenly fizzes and sprays from the sipply cups drinking holes!  
  
Next we went to the desert dome. It is a large glass dome in which you walk through and see many deserts around the world and the animals that live in them. Nicely done and they manage to pack in a lot more stuff into it than it would appear to be able to hold when looking at it from the outside.  
  
Next we saw the bears. We saw a "honey" bear that climbed up to it's tallest tree branches which are just a few feet from the upper viewing level where we stood. We next went down to see polar bears floating in the water tank.  
  
After that came the atrium. It's a fairly large enclosure that holds all types of birds.  
  
By this time it was getting to the end of the day and most of the other animals were too far to walk to, so our next destination was the train. We waited an hour and a half for the train. Enid and I both decided it was too long to wait, but we had already invested so much time into that we didn't want to leave. It turned out to be the highlight of the trip for Ora 5. If you ask him what his favorite part of the day was, he will tell you "the train."  
  
I was reminded that when my family went to New York City when I was kid, mom and dad had planned to see the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and that was it. When Orion and I learned this, we begged them to take us into the city. They acquiesced and we took the Staten Island Ferry into Manhattan. We walked past Wall Street and then on to the Twin Towers. We walked through a huge room with "cattle runners" for all the people. Took the elevator up to the observation deck and watched NYC turn dark and light up. It was the highlight of the trip for all of us.  
  
Lesson learned: Sometimes going out of your way our staying too long can be very very good.  
  
Then it was time to go. We left through the gift shop and got each person something to remember the zoo by.  
  
The Henry Doorly Zoo has several advantages of the KC zoo. It has several big "marquee" attractions such as the rainforest, desert dome and aquarium. (They are also building an orangutan climbing forest.) All these attractions are clustered at the front of the front of the zoo, so you can see most of the "big" stuff without going very far. It also suffers from some of the same problems: it's other animals are too far away. You can see them by train or tram, but the train and trams are pretty far back as well. This is one area where the KC zoo has them beat: KC has trains and trams right up front to take you to some of the farther attractions. It's hard to tell, but I think the KC zoo is larger than the Henry Doorly Zoo, but I don't know for sure. I would love to see some of the "big" stuff in KC!  
  
That night we cooked dinner. Our inexpensive Wal-Mart cookware and dinner ware wasn't doing so well. Lesson learned: These items you can't go cheap on and nothing substitutes for a cast-iron skillet. The Coleman lantern and new stove we bought worked great. I have a 40 year old Coleman stove that runs on the Coleman fuel, but decided to "update" so I could use propane. I'm glad I did because it is so much easier. Than night Ora 5 helped us do dishes and then we built another fire. Then off to bed.
