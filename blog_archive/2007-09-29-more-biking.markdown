Ora 5 and I worked on his biking some more this morning. He is doing very well, but stopping is still a problem particularly as he begins to pick up speed on the gradually downhill of our street. We worked on braking without coming to a full stop. I ran with him a bit as he did this and then let him try it once on his own with almost disastrous results. He couldn't stop himself fully as he went down the hill and as I watched and yelled he almost entered a busy intersection. So we worked on coming to a full stop for  a bit.   
  
After about 10-15 minutes he had this mastered as well. There's nothing more for me to teach him.  
  
Aspen, seeing that Ora was riding now, decided she wanted to try her bike which she has shunned up until this point. So I took her out into the road and we worked on pedaling, braking and turning.
