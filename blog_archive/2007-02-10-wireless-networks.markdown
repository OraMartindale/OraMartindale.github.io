I have a borrowed laptop for the week and it has a wireless card. I booted it up and it told me that there were 3 wireless networks that it detected! _Hmm... Can I get some free internet out of this?_ I thought. No such luck. Apparently my neighbors are smart enough to secure this network, which is very impressive since I didn't think I had three neighbors savvy enough to have wireless networks.
