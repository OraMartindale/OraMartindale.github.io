Ora 5 placed his tooth under his pillow last night and I replaced it with $1. I figured 3 children times 20 teeth means that I'll be out $60 over the next 6 years.  
  
Ora must have heard us talking about when I lost my at Granny and Papa's house: instead of the usual 25 cents, I awoke with quite a bit more money. Ora brought his dollar to me and asked "Can I buy my tooth back?"  
  
"Why?" I asked.  
  
"I want to put it under my pillow at Papa's house when we go there next month."  
  
At first I wasn't sure what to think: "You greedy little boy!" or "What an entrepreneur!" I decided that if he wanted to give up his dollar and try for more, I would let him, so I gave him his dollar back.
