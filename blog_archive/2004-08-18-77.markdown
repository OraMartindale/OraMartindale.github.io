**Backerboard is done**
  
My dad came over again today and we cut and placed the last of the backerboard pieces.
  

  
Next step: Tiling


  

  


**10,227 days**
  
I also turned 28 today. I read in a magazine once that 27 was the perfect age and then gave examples of celebrities that had their breakout years when they were 27. Now that it's gone, I hope they were wrong. =)
