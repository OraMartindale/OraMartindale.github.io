My [first blog post on martindale.org](/2002/10/according-to-box-office-guru-jonah-has.asp) was in regard to the VeggieTales movie Jonah. Tonight we saw their second movie The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.  
  
It was fun, but not nearly as good as a Pixar movie in terms of animation quality or budget. The kids liked it, which is more than I can say for Ice Age or Robots.
