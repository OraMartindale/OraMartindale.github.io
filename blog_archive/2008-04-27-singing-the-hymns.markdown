For the past few weeks, Ora 5 has been standing with us during the songs at church and trying to read the words. Today I caught him following along with every word in the hymnal. His finger would scroll along under the words of the verse in perfect unison with the song. The only part that gave him problems was when we would get to the end of the line and he would try to go to the next verse on the same line instead of the correct verse on the next line of music.
