Two groups of idiots conspired against me this morning: Those Miami-Dade voters who are too stupid to know who they are voting for and those idiots in congress who passed a law that we must get rid of those "butterfly ballots."  
  
So, I went to vote this morning. I was excited because our county finally got the touch-screen voting machines instead of "butterfly ballots." I want in and I see one of the election officials on the phone with tech support. They hand me the paper ballot that is supposed to go into the machine and a pencil. Great! I'm back in 6th grade filling in circles meticulously otherwise no college will call me!  
  
It took me over 5 minutes to fill in the circles and only voted for half the issues! If I had the "butterfly ballot," I would have punched, flipped, punched, flipped, punched flipped and been out of there in 1 minute!  
  
After filling out the ballot I slip it into a machine that looks like a large printer that sucks paper in rather than spits it out. The machine gives me NO feedback. There is no light that turns green, no display that indicates it got my ballot, no voice to say "Thank you for voting today."  
  
Overall, my voting experience sucked! I've seen the future of voting and it's not better! And I still hate everyone in Miami-Dade county.
