Ora 5 had to have a tooth pulled today. He was excited!? The dentist had told him that he would get "funny gas." So Ora went in with a lot of anticipation. Apparently he was not disappointed, because he enjoyed the "funny gas" and didn't feel the extraction. The dentist gave him a small plastic cube with his tooth in it. When Ora got home and opened it, he found a $1 bill. An early tooth fairy gift. (My coworkers later told me to check the bill to see if there was an odd $1 charge.)  
  
Later, when the funny gas wore off, Ora had a lot of pain.
