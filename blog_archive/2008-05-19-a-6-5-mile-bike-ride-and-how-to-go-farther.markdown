We went our riding again tonight. This time to Indian Creek Trail. Here's the kids at the beginning:

And Enid:

At the end of the ride we found a waterfall:

Enid rode a little further and found that parts of the trail that were closed for highway construction have reopened, so now there is a continuous trail 11 miles (one way), plus a few more miles on the Missouri side.  
  
We also found that Ora 5 seems to be hitting a wall at 3-3.5 miles into our ride, forcing us to head back. We decided that on future rides one of us will ride with Ora and the other will ride ahead and get some long mileage riding in.
