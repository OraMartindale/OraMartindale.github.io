by [Les Standiford](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9886.Les_Standiford)  
rating: 1 of 5 stars  
This book sounded promising but was boring until the last few chapters when it gets to the war of 1812 and the renewed interest of the cities architect 70 years after his death.  
  
The author does a nice job at the beginning of tying the idea of the terrorism of 9/11 to the burning of Washington, D.C., and then he ties that back nicely at the end.  
  
The rest of the book is like reading the minutes of Congressional meetings.
