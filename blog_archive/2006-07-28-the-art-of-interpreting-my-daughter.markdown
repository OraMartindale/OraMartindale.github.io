Aspen has begun to say a lot of things that aren't clear, but once you hear them a few times you begin to pick up on them. Often, what she says doesn't even sound like what she's trying to say, but the context, cadence or frequency of saying it give it away. Enid is better at it than I am:  
  
"dink" = drink, as in "I want a drink."  
  
"one maanut" = 1 minute, what we often say when we are busy when she asks for something.  
  
"wah wub" = "I want to watch Piglet's Big Movie." Yeah, it's a stretch, but that is what she means.  
  
Tonight Ora bean singing "Ring around the Rosie, Pocket full of posie" and Aspen finished with "asheesh, asheesh, ah fa da" and then she threw herself to the ground.
