Aspen's travel habits changed subtly this week. She's been taking steps and she'll walk for distances if she is holding your hand; however this week at some point she began walking instead of crawling as her preferred method. Before she would walk if you coaxed her, but if she really wanted to move she'd revert to crawling. But now she is choosing to walk and only reverting when it seems too difficult to walk.
