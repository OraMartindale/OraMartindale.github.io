We were sleeping in this morning and Ora 5 and Aspen came into our room this morning. Ora climbed into bed into between Enid and I and then Aspen looked at me and asked "Are you going to get out of bed?" Thinking that she wanted me to get up with her and make her breakfast, I said "Yes" and got up. Aspen promptly laid in the spot that I had vacated and pulled the covers over herself!
