**Have you forgotten? by Darryl Worley**
  


<blockquote>I hear people saying 
  
We don’t need this war 
  
But I say there’s some things worth fighting for 
  
What about our freedom and this piece of ground 
  
We didn’t get to keep them by backing down 
  
Now they say we don’t realize the mess we’re getting in 
  
Before you start to preaching let me ask you this my friend 
  

  
Have you forgotten how it felt that day? 
  
Too see your homeland under fire and her people blown away 
  
Have you forgotten when those towers fell? 
  
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell 
  
And you say we shouldn’t worry about Bin Laden 
  
Have you forgotten? 
  

  
They took all the footage off my TV 
  
They said it’s too disturbing for you and me 
  
It’ll just breed anger, it’s what the experts say 
  
If it was up to me I’d show it everyday 
  
Some say this country’s just out looking for a fight 
  
Well after 9-11 man I’d have to say that’s right 
  

  
Have you forgotten how it felt that day? 
  
Too see your homeland under fire and her people blown away 
  
Have you forgotten when those towers fell? 
  
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell 
  
And you say we shouldn’t worry about Bin Laden 
  
Have you forgotten? 
  

  

  
I’ve been there with the soldiers who’ve gone away to war 
  
And you can bet that they remember just what they’re fighting for 
  

  
Have you forgotten all the people killed? 
  
Yeah some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field 
  
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon? 
  
Yeah all those loved ones that we lost 
  
And those left to carry on 
  
Don’t you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden 
  
Have you forgotten how it felt that day? 
  
Too see your homeland under fire and her people blown away 
  
Have you forgotten when those towers fell? 
  
We had people still inside going through a living hell 
  
And you say we shouldn’t worry about Bin Laden 
  
Have you forgotten? </blockquote>
