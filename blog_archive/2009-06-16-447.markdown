[![Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution--and How It Can Renew America](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BXht2rkUL._SX106_.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2358737.Hot_Flat_and_Crowded_Why_We_Need_a_Green_Revolution_and_How_It_Can_Renew_America) [Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution--and How It Can Renew America](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2358737.Hot_Flat_and_Crowded_Why_We_Need_a_Green_Revolution_and_How_It_Can_Renew_America) by [Thomas L. Friedman](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18675.Thomas_L_Friedman)

  
  


rating: 3 of 5 stars  
  
In his last book (The World is Flat), Friedman said that the US needed to be competitive in a "flat" world. In this book, he lays out a plan for leading the world in a green economy. He gives several points as to why we should be in the green economy. If you don't find his global warming argument compelling than you will find a compelling argument that we are funding terrorism with every dollar we spend on gasoline.

  
  


He gives a fascinating glimpse of a hopeful energy independent future using examples of ingenuity that are being built and tested right now.

  
  


Unfortunately, his last chapter is how none of this can happen without the government passing laws to create this new bright future. Laws that will be impossible to pass.
