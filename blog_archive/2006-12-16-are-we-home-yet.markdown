A while back I grew tired of hearing "Are we there yet?" I told Ora, I would no longer answer those questions and I now remain silent when either Ora or Aspen ask.  
  
Today, Ora found someone else to answer:  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
Ora: "Are we home yet?"  
  
Aspen: "No."  
  
All the way home.
