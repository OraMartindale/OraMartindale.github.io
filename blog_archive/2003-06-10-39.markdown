**The American Dream: Owning a Mortgage?**
  
I'm almost to the end of Mary Hunt's book. One of her last chapters contains the idea that the "American Dream" is dead. Ask most people what the American Dream is and owning a house will be towards the top of the list. It's been that way for decades. But most people do not own a house, Ms. Hunt contends; we own a mortgage. 70 years ago, when someone said they wanted to own their home, they worked hard to actually **pay off the mortgage**. Then they would have mortgage burning parties. That's rare today. I only know 4 people who actually own their homes by this definition.
  

  
Ms. Hunt says the cost of owning a home has increased by over 50 times what it was in the '20s, but our incomes have far surpassed 50 times what incomes were then, so today it should actually be easier to own our home. Most of us simply think that a mortgage is something we'll have for the rest of our lives.
  

  
No moral here. No "you should be doing this." Just food for thought.
