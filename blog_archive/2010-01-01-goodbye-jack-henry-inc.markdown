After 10 years, 10 months and 9 days, I have resigned from Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. I consider it my first "real" job in that it was a job that was in the career field I had chosen and my first job out of college didn't teach me anything or accomplish anything.  
  
I joined Jack Henry as a single young man and in my time there I was married and had three children. When I joined, benefits like medical insurance and 401K were not something that even crossed my mind. Jack Henry stood beside me through a growing family and medical complications with the birth of all three of my kids; gave me many opportunities to grow as a programmer; good friends and a lot of good memories.  
  
But there comes a time when you realize that your opportunity to grow and advance your career doesn't exist where you are anymore and I reached that point. So after more than a decade with JHA, I start a new year and a new decade in a new place. More on that later.
