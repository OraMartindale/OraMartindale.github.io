Today was our first milestone ride: 10 miles. Some friends watched the kids while we drove to Longview Lake and biked around it. It was also our first ride on-road. We road the 10 miles in an hour and saw lots of other bikers.  
  
I began to wonder if they knew something that I did not because they rode around the lake clockwise while we rode counter-clockwise. Later I realized that by riding their direction, they are actually riding a shorter path; like being on the inside ring of a track instead of the outside.
